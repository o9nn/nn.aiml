Not Memristor—

Synthesis of Atoms and Crystals
Made of Magnetic Light
8.1 IT IS RESISTANCE FOR VORTEX
ATOMS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS
The 3D topological pattern of a very weak magnetic field plays
a fundamental role in governing the formation of a star (Pattle
et al., 2018). Weak magnetic fields are there everywhere in
the biological system, now even the magnetic field around a
single atom has been measured (Willke et al., 2019). The electric field has a monopole as positive or negative charge; one
can isolate positive and negative charge separately. The magnetic field does not have such a provision. Once the debate
regarding the supremacy of electric field over the magnetic
field was settled in the 1820s by Lord Kelvin, no one questioned why the current flow that is fundamental to the electric field is required to generate a magnetic flux, why not the
phase flow alone builds a magnetic flux that is an integral part
of a magnetic field. There are plenty of reports of generating magnetic flux by flowing current, it is a must to happen,
regulating magnetic phase, spin flow, magnetic wave flow,
everything could be easily feasible following the guideline
of Maxwell’s law (Matsukura et al., 2015; Stöhr et al., 2009;
Lottermoser et al., 2004; Henke et al., 1981; Figure 8.1a).
There has been an attempt to change the electric polarization
vector or phase using magnetic phase (Ishiwata et al., 2008).

Electric field controlling the magnetic field could easily be
realized. However, the electron would not flow, yet the magnetic flux would flow appeared not possible unless one discovers the magnetic monopole. Instead of a magnetic monopole,
it is easy to build, magnetic vortex atom and do similar work,
as it is done for Hinductor.
So, an electric charge has to move, and only then a magnetic field is generated. The quest for a magnetic monopole
started long ago (Dirac, 1931), when Dirac argued for a unique
magnetic monopole. Giant accelerators tried to find a monopole fundamental to the universe, but failed. Now, the lattice
defect-induced vortex of a magnetic field is found to mimic
the magnetic ring. Vortices could happen in a small excitable
media like a time crystal (Winfree, 1986b, 1990, 1994). Spiral
features can take us to use the topological feature, and that
enables using the negative refractive index (Pendry, 2004).
Supramolecular springs and ratchets have an intimate relationship (Mahadevan and Matsudaira, 2000), and entropic
effects do play a fundamental role in the composite d­ ynamics.
It should be noted that for computing or decision-making,
this might not be essential. One recent course of historic
development started when rotational angular momentum was
introduced to light; here, it would be a journey to the universalization of angular momentum of light.

FIGURE 8.1 (a) Maxwell’s equations (top) and a table for missing fourth-circuit element, a new symbol for H-Hinductor device different
from Memristor. (b) The schematic of the device for the fourth-circuit element, change in the stored charge reflects in the change in produced
magnetic flux. (c) A table is comparing the world of electronics and the world of magnonics, if magnetic particle an equivalent to charge is
found using vortex atoms proposed by Kelvin.

Why do we need fourth-circuit element: Memristor
is not the fourth-circuit element: No brain component
should use significant energy; if we do, then the integration of
100 billion devices would require megawatts of a power supply. Considering all critical limits, one could find that we need
to confine power expenditure of entire human brain hardware
within a few kilo-watts and, therefore, the power consumption
in a single neuron equivalent device cannot be more than a
few nano-watts or microwatts. Such a frequency-fractal processor device was proposed in 2014 (Ghosh et al., 2014a). One
has to invent a fractal-processing device, that generates time
crystal with quaternion, octonion, and dodecanion features,
and for that purpose, we start with the fourth-circuit element.
In the 1870s, three basic electronic devices the capacitor,
inductor and resistors were known. Leon Chua was the first
to notice that by symmetry argument magnetic flux and the
stored charge should be linked by an unprecedented device,
he called it memristor (Chua, 1971; Figure 8.1b). Memristor
is not a fourth-circuit element; any device that created the
biggest sensation in the world in 2008 (Strukov et al., 2008),
to realize cannot generate magnetic flux is not a fourth circuit element. Chua himself wrote in 1971s seminal paper that
all memristor properties could be derived using inductor L,
capacitor C, and resistor R. Hence memristor, even one goes
by the view of the main proposer is not a fundamental circuit element. Moreover, since all properties of memristor,

memcapacitor, and meminductor (Di Ventra and Pershin,
2013) could be derived using conventional circuit elements,
one cannot consider this as a fundamental element at all.
In contrast, no combination of primary circuit elements could
generate the electronic properties of the fourth-circuit element. Therefore, it is unique. The missing memristor remains
unfound despite thousands of follow-up articles.
The paradox of fourth-circuit element: Why memristor
could be an inductor but never a fourth-circuit element:
The proposal for the fourth-circuit element has a paradox
(Figure 8.1b). If an electric current flow for linearly changing
the magnetic flux, then it is an inductor, no more a fundamental circuit ­element. On the other hand, if the charge does
not move yet, a magnetic flux is produced, and then Maxwell’s
law described in Figure 8.1a violates. Universalizing Dirac’s
classic 1931 charge-flux quantization holds an answer to this
paradox—if Dirac strings are spiral, magnetic monopoles
could survive together even in ambient atmospheric condition. Resolving the paradox using a generic magnetic pole
generator would open the door to building usable practical
devices (Figure 8.1c). We suggest getting out of the intense
quest to find a universal magnetic charge as a fundamental
particle and limiting the quest to finding a free particle-like
magnetic entity ( B  E ) that does not require an accelerating charge and does not require an external massive magnetic
field to observe. Further qualification of such free particle-like

Hinductor Not Memristor—Synthesis of Atoms and Crystals Made of Magnetic Light

structures would be (i) self-assembly of these magnetic particles would generate more magnetic field like an electric
charge, (ii) generation of electric charge by rotation of magnetic particle, and (iii) rotational direction of a field like spin.
Knots of darkness generated by a coil, a supercoil, a
super-super coil is tubule-morphic, not neuromorphic:
When we look at a DNA molecule vertically from the top,
it looks like a flower. The origin of flower shape is a twist in
its spiral. There are two spirals superposed on each other, in
summary it is a spiral of a spiral. The twist creates a mixed
defect of an edge dislocation and a line dislocation on the
cylindrical surface. DNA is not alone; α-helices in the protein, tubulin dimer, microtubule nanowire, several protein
complexes hold such a unique twist in the spiral. One of the
most significant advantages of using a helical geometry is that
due to the geometric shape alone the spiral pathway quantizes signal, thenceforth filters noise. The ultra-low pitch spiral design allows several alternative spiral channels to operate
simultaneous signals, the quantization of energy happens.
Naturally, quantum effects generate in an ambient condition
(Atanasova and Dandoloff, 2008). When we change the surface design, the optical signal falling on the surface would
diffract and interfere; the resultant 3D pattern would carry
a signature of that surface. One could see dark lines floating
in the 3D space. In the optical vortex studies, these studies
are done frequently. We state explicitly that in these lines,
electric field E = 0. Really? No one ever checked whether
or not Maxwell’s equations are at all valid inside those dark
lines. Someone should do it. We leave that and introduce the
coil of coil of coils, or super-super coil. The α-helices of a
tubulin monomer form a coil which generates three kinds of
diffraction patterns.
Imagine a cylinder. On its surface, through an imaginary
spiral, a set of dark lines along with dark rings are moving
clockwise. On its surface through an imaginary spiral, hairpin-like shapes and dark ring are flowing counter-clockwise.
On its surface longitudinally, super-super coils of dark lines
(Nye, 1983) are moving. Thus, three coexisting dynamics are
equivalent to three Bloch spheres. Each Bloch sphere has a
great circle with singularity points on its perimeter. The singularity points in a circle constitute a geometric shape. Thus,
DNA or α-helices like spirals are the smallest unit of information. Supercoil of α-helices is a tubulin dimer, and the
super supercoil of α-helices is a microtubule. Thus, microtubule nanowire is a triplet of coils, and it is the smallest unit of
the tubule-morphic device.
The background history of the magnetic vortices: If
a semiconductor sandwiched between a pair of metal electrodes exhibits hysteresis and bistable states, one could flip
between the two resistances like a switch, then it is memristor.
Since current flow is allowed in Chua’s memristor, one could
make an inductor-like device and generate magnetic flux,
too. However, if one remained strict to the definition and was
determined to build a device that does not flow any current yet
produces a magnetic flux, then several critical research fields
of contemporary physics need to be bridged. However, if successful, magnetic resonance would enable using the negative

221

index of refraction (Valentine et al., 2008), super-lensing
(Smith, 2004) and cloaking (Schurig et al., 2006). Magnetic
wireless communication is superior to electrical communication as electrical signal does not diminish while passing
through water, moisture and metal.
Moreover, a magnetic field penetrates most insulator
materials. The barrier should have another specialty, an electromagnetic lensing effect that converts emitted electromagnetic burst into a magnetic one. A barrier or boundary of a
key device element might play key roles in building noiseresistant protection (Figure 8.2a). There are multiple routes
(Karaveli and Zia, 2010). Charge storage is controlled by
resonance frequencies of input ac signal oscillating them
coherently initiating an antenna like the radiation of magnetic
ripples (Figure 8.2b, c). Even though the charges do not move
out of the well, due to an extremely insulated matrix outside,
they oscillate physically as a group (Figure 8.2c, d). Thus,
Maxwell’s law is not violated. Since the current does not flow,
still a magnetic flux is produced; therefore, the device cannot
be tagged as an inductor. The linear relation between stored
charge and produced magnetic flux suggests that it is a fourthcircuit element, but one does not get any reasonable currentvoltage characteristic as the memristor demands. In this
fourth-circuit element, the electrical resistance is infinity, but
another resistance, the ratio between flux and charge is 0.001,
i.e., very low. Following suggestions of Chua, Sahu et al. have
given their device a distinct identity, namely Hinductor, and
assigned it in a different class than a memristor.
Electric vector is 104 times more than the magnetic vector: The model explored for the fourth-circuit element, is a
helical wire made of dots that are a special kind of quantum
well or traps. The well is so designed that the electric vector is
perpendicular to its wall’s surface and magnetic field vector is
in the plane with the wall. The density of states of the virtual
wall’s 2D surface lenses the electric vector and adds a part
of it to the magnetic vector. One to two orders magnetic field
enhancement by confining electrons and then accelerating
them through the depleted field created by surface topology is
a reasonably well-understood phenomenon (Shan et al., 2001;
Johnston et al., 2002a, 2002b; Figure 8.2c, d). A subtle change
in the stored electron would change the topology of surface
depleted field, thus, regulating the phase correlation of coherent emission from this well like nano-antenna (Biagioni et al.,
2012; Michler et al., 2000). Both in the classical and the quantum systems, the emission survives only for a few picoseconds, until the coherent resonance burst survives. The phase
space interaction suggests the formation of a spiral path
(Figure 8.3a), optical axis ensures the purity of two interfering
waves (Figure 8.3b, d). So, we arrange multiple wells in a 3D
spiral arrangement (Empedocles et al., 1999; Figure 8.3c) so
that the magnetic flux acquires a stable experimentally measurable standing wave. Interference on the spiral path could
depict the signature of magnetic radiation distinctly from the
electrical contribution (Freed and Weissman, 1941). Arrayed
structure assists in enhancing the magnetic field (Cui et al.,
2016). Imaging the magnetic flux has been a challenging task
(Vignolini et al., 2010). Normally, magnetic vector interacts

104 times less than the electric vector with the electrons of
a sensor, so detecting a magnetic flux in the light has been a
challenge, so metamaterials are used where conducting rings
sense the magnetic flux rapidly (Schirber, 2010).
Topologically protected spin textures could be resonantly
excited and its elliptical dynamics which contain anticlockwise and clockwise modes could be tuned by applying different frequencies of the microwave field (Figure 8.3a, e).
The conversion between these two elliptical modes is achieved
by a transition to linear vibration (Jin et al., 2017). One could
do such phase modulation by applying THz pulses generated
by surface depletion field. Infrared signals of 5–6 THz (~300–
320 K, little above room temperature) get frequency modulated to the lower THz regime 60–300 GHz, by the topology
of the surface.
Do not look for a superconductor, look for super insulator: Since charges are not moving out of the quantum
well, as if all the wells are floating in an infinite resistance
or extremely insulating matrix, the charges formed inside the

well remain trapped (Figure 8.2b). In this scenario, the differential conductance, the key to almost all major electronics theory and experiments do not work,—sending a current
or applying a voltage, returns no output. However, if a new
differential, the relative variation of flux and charge, or differential flux-charge is measured, in some systems where
its value is very low in spite of a nearly infinite resistance,
a new type of communication could be found. Dimensions
of differential conductance and differential flux-charge are
the same. However, the physical significance is very different, while the first, is governed by collision and scattering of
carriers (e.g., electrons, quasi-charge), for the later, the topology of charge-trap centers in the matrix of extreme insulators is the key (Figure 8.1c). While avoiding the collision and
scattering have guided the ultra-low, noise-free quantum and
classical adventures, the differential charge-flux has no such
weakness. It means, one could in principle measure, quantum
effects in ambient atmosphere, just like we do it in quan­
tum optics. One has to measure three hallmarks of quantum,

fractional quasi-charge, the ripples of a quantum well and the
Fermi velocity (Lykken et al., 1970) which were thus far measured using the differential conductance, using differential
flux-charge. Using them Sahu et al. estimated the magnetic
flux and charge associated with the quantum capacitance and
quantum inductance of a tubulin monomer; and accurately
determined that no kind of wiring works for quantum elements. Sahu et al. verified the reliability of this new differential by building a theory, how quantum well emitted the
magnetic rings interfere to form standing wave and then live
to image the standing wave of magnetic flux. Its origin is a
quantum antenna driven by oscillating charge trapped within
that shapes the field correlations, emits a magnetic field at resonance, even if a single pair of tori interfere, the spiral standing waveforms.

8.1.1 Quantum Non-Demolition: e − π − φ
Quadratic Sensors
Quantum demolition a historical perspective: Making
the quantum analogs of classical electromagnetism laws,
and everything that we find in the classical world has been
a faithful practice for the quantum researchers for a long

time. No attempts were ever made to see what happens if the
resistance that destroys the quantum coherence is increased
critically arresting the motion of an electron. Critical environments often lead to quantum effects, but the laws prohibited us from seeing anything by arresting the electron
flow critically. In a quantum world a quasi-particle wave can
interfere without flowing electrons, the waves edit phase to
exhibit unique topological resonance by quantum interference. Despite several attempts to safeguard information during measurement, it is still an open question whether it is
at all possible to measure information without modifying or
destroying natural weak vibrations. In the last 50 years all
efforts to evade quantum demolition were optical (Braginsky,
1980; Sewell et al., 2013). Earlier, isolation was a route to
make a device silent, e.g., “flux capacitor,” which was really
a one-way optical loop for helping isolate sensitive quantum
equipment.
Resistance-less paths for the clocks to transmit and
doing mathematics: vibrate the cavity boundary for
e − π − φ : Flowing a charge through the resistance fewer paths
has been the key to survive a quantum effect. It means that
we do not want the carrier, be it electron, quasi-particles or
photon to move out of the cavity, rather, remain trapped in the

224

cavity forever, do not even leak. So, we want super-insulators
where the Fermi velocity of carriers is very low and which are
vibrating mechanically. Due to the coupled vibrations among
the cavity boundaries we get a mechanical rhythm. Periodic
or clocking oscillation generates a magnetic field or a loop that
absorbs more electric vectors in its plane. Thus, the necessity
of clocks delivers a coupled electrical mechanical and magnetic rhythm leading to e − π − φ . Similar to the electronic
route, an alternate phase route could lead to a plethora of technologies to minimizing the resistance for the phase flow along
the path, so that the magnetic field or magnetic flux carries the
quantum information with null resistance just like the cooper
pairs face in a superconducting material.
The development of a new kind of e − π − φ sensor:
Normally, during the measurement of information in a material, the pump-probe technique is used. Even the day-today multimeters we use, it pumps a large bias to the device
under test and then measures its response. Instead of pumping external energy to amplify enough to sense its response,
one could envision a new thermo-magneto differential sensor that is tuned to interfere and modulate the geometric
phases of magnetic flux waves produced at the atomic scale
to the micro scale. The new culture of phase-based magnonics that might replace electronics in the coming future
would rely on the coupled geometric resonance e − π − φ .
Imagine a futuristic world where instead of the multimeter
that measures current-voltage we could have a cheap fluxcharge meter. Most importantly we would not be pumping
huge energy and then measure the outcry of the device under
test. Synchronizing with the e − π − φ coupled oscillation
requires a very small amount of energy that runs a search
mode to find the right e − π − φ condition in a device, if that
is done, then the new generation e − π − φ sensor would
read the flux-charge properties like the hinductance H without destroying the basic parameters. Instead of relying on
the conventional electrical parameters like current or voltage, three simultaneous recordings allow reading the rate
of change of flux as a function of charge directly in a pure
form. Literature is rich with infrared sensors (Peng et al.,
2015) and magnetic flux sensors (Shi and Li, 2011). When a
fourth-circuit element Hinductor, H explores the geometry
of a device so extensively, noise harvesting becomes natural
and heat pipe effect often dominates the noise to signal conversion (Wang and Gundevia, 2013).

8.1.2 Rapidly Oscillating Cell Membrane
Holding a Long Wave
Classical waves can pick up geometric phase, exclusively
preserved for quantum: Imagine a core-shell structure,
where the boundary that makes a cavity have a different
dielectric property than the filling material inside the cavity
acting as a dielectric resonator. Boundary and inner structure vibrate very differently (Figure 8.2a). Hinductor coils
(Figure 8.2b) are like single molecules, and the boundaries vibrate very slowly (kHz) than its internal core material, which vibrates at MHz or GHz, i.e., radio wave or

Nanobrain

microwave frequencies. Thus, boundary and internal structure get energetically isolated. Even in a noisy environment, the boundary isolates unwanted input, makes internal
rapidly vibrating structure into an adiabatic system. If the
boundary vibrates periodically, then the wave function representing the internal structure would acquire a geometric
phase in addition to a dynamic, phase. This wave could be
a classical wave, so, at room temperature, ambient environment an electric, magnetic or mechanical wave could
acquire geometric phase that was thought to be a prerogative of a quantum world (Lauber et al., 1994). How do we
prove it? Check Ahranov-Bohm effect, i.e., where electromagnetic interference carries quantum information (Mead
and Truhlar, 1979). In summary we get dynamic and geometric phase added to the electromagnetic signal passing
through a molecular structure.
Electromagnetic, mechanical, and magnetic vibration of the membrane: Since 1930s, routinely measured
protein vibrations (Vollmer et al., 2002; Zhai et al., 2000;
Hanham et al., 2015) have failed to become a marker to
detect the onset of a disease early, as subtle measurements
flip a large number of its vibration modes. As protein
vibrates at many different frequencies at a time, no probe
exists to read multiple energy domains at once, classical
markers cannot instantly detect fractional changes in the
resonance frequencies caused by mutation or virus attack.
To measure quantum capacitance and quantum inductance
are quantum markers of geometric resonance of proteins
are wavelike, means, originates purely from wave reflectance, transmittance and interference. So, a minute change
in protein’s local structural symmetry makes a significant
change in phase. Earlier Sahu et al. reported significant
changes in the resonance frequencies of microtubule as it
becomes cancerous. Now, the same effect is read quantum
mechanically to enhance the energy detection resolution to
10 −21 eV, a new e − π − φ probe detects the subtle changes in
the internal degrees of freedom, yet momentum conservation yields Planks constant repeatedly. Measurement is selffault tolerant hence fit to dip in a living cell for the quantum
detection of a disease at the very onset.

8.1.3

Paraxial Systems

A paraxial system means a transverse component of the
electric vector contributes to the magnetic part of an electromagnetic wave stream (Figure 8.2e). Electric and magnetic vectors behave uniquely in a paraxial system (Berry,
2004). The device is a doublet or triplets of identical concentric cylinders of diameter D, length L, made of spirally
arranged m nano-dielectric resonators in one helical period,
with a total Ω number of quadrilateral lattice cells, each with
sides a and b (Figure 8.3a). The spirals with pitch P, are further twisted by an angle δ . One cylinder with a 2D array
of dielectric nanoparticles amplifies both E and B together,
while two cylinders, each with an edge and screw defects
at a relative angle α between the layers, create two distinct
spatially isolated ­vortices, one electric (E >> B) and the other

225

Hinductor Not Memristor—Synthesis of Atoms and Crystals Made of Magnetic Light

magnetic, E << B. For three layers, the knots change shape
with time. Noise shifts the coils relative to each other, it tunes
α, the angle between the overlapping dark lines, since coils
are identical, noise initiates a beating which filters out E
mixed in the dark B lines. A Fabry-Perot interferometer like
set up was used to amplify B by infinite repeated reflections
between the plane wave bender and the vortex lens. To see
the ripples of magnetic vortices, move away from optical vortex, put a large 12″ × 12″ magnetic film to find the invisible
magnetic vortex location, rotate the sample in a quartz cell
to fine-tune the intensity of B in the vortex, keep the solution
opacity at 60%, project it too far >5 m, do not use a lens to
focus the vortex atoms, most spirals and fractals would give
such vortex crystals.
The device operation follows two simultaneous steps. To
write or erase a dynamic feature one has to send an ac signal
ω to resonantly vibrate the surface cells, then shine a monochromatic polarized light to read the encoded information as
a crystal of magnetic vortex. Quantum systems like vibrating
molecules or nuclei, do not have fixed, but vibrating boundaries with momentum m*v = ∇∅. This vibrating boundary adds a geometric phase ∅ to the trapped signal ω .
The trapped signal and the direct input signal interfere and
give rise to Ahranov-Bohm effect at an ambient atmosphere.
A very low-frequency signal ω0 is born, the wavelength is far
greater than the cell size (a, b  λ , paraxiality). Two events
happen in parallel. The cell delays signal, oscillating walls


build ψ trap , then emits ψ Osci, finally builds ψ mag globally on

the cylinder surface. Since ( a, b  λ ) , the deviation θ of E

vector is very low, i.e., sin θ λ → θ λ, the signal ψ mag follows different spiral paths (anisotropy), distinct paths activate
N vibrational modes. Thus, input high-frequency signal ω,
generates N very low-frequency signals (ω1, ω2 …ωi .ωn ) , as
G-band, which interferes and creates distinct local density of
states on the cylindrical surface, L, P, D and area ab sets
 the
boundary condition for interference. Thus, in-plane E vectors are consumed by the cells but the coupled G-modes with
wave vectors ki, ki +1 modulates ∅ as tan −1 ki +1 1 + ki, a pre
cession ±∅ to the B vector in those plane waves whose E
vectors
 lie along
 the cell plane (Figure 8.2e). For a mode i,
all B ( x, y ) = Bcos∅ vectors perpendicular to the cylindrical

surface delivers an average sum of magnetic flux B ( x, y ) .
Thus, plane-polarized light shined on a cylinder acquires coupling coefficient CCi of all vibrational modes activated by
ω , in its B vector. Modes are visible in the quantum tunneling images.

8.1.4 Anisotropy and Avoided Crossing
Planar chiral structures automatically develop an anisotropy
in the propagating electromagnetic, asymmetric structures
even split the electromagnetic wave (Fedotov et al., 2006).
Engineering artificial dressed states: Say we draw a set
of parallel lines (Figure 8.3a). Then, another set of parallel
lines crossing the other. At the junctions we keep an element
that stores charge or delays the motion of charge passing
through the matrix. If we build a cylinder by arranging and

spiraling balls, we can create several cross-bar patterns on the
surface. The most interesting part is that the flowing charges
dwell for a longer time along the parallel paths, it is analogous
to trapping a charge. We do not restrict what would be the
charge, could be a quasi-particle, or an elementary particle, it
is the designer’s choice. The question is to control these states.

with an energy gap ∆ (Figure 8.3b). On a spiral cylinder, if
there are different types of parallel paths, each set of paths
have a distinct resonance frequency ω0, and applied energy Eac
generates a signal ωt . Here n number of quanta is exchanged
continuously between E±, even without any metallic layer
H = Eac ( n12 + n22 +…+ 2i n)… H1. Thus, at around the resonance frequency, we get dressed states, i.e., the wave vector
k = 2π / λ oscillates periodically (cos k ), following
E± = 2 (1 − cos k )

(8.2)

hence we get a periodically oscillating band gap (Figure 8.3d),
the wave vector K * switches between elliptical and circular
polarization. Consequently, the basic definition of cavity resonance or dielectric resonance is not valid here. External noise
activates the cells in the crossbar pattern, but external ordered
signals disrupt natural communication between clocks. Even
using the term resonance is not valid in strict terms. The crossbar trap’s dimension d does not decide vibrational clocking
frequency of trapped charge, in fact, λ  d. The particular
condition, λ  d, transverse components of electromagnetic
wave contributes to the longitudinal component. The light or
electromagnetic wave of any frequency range would experience magnetic or electric parts feeding the other, depending
on polarization direction.
Rupturing the band gap: In the have topological insulators, or semiconductors the carriers transmit through
specialized paths, the valence and conduction bands do
not remain flat mostly separated by an energy gap, they bend
to touch each other. These are called broken bands, where
the fermi surfaces of the valence and the conduction band
are curved so much that they are ruptured (Figure 8.3c).
The critically curved regions may extend valence to conductance bands, even make contacts (Dirac points). These
contact paths are topological routes, a carefully crafted path
on the materials through which the changes move, or simply send phase information without any physical communication. Such points are called avoided crossing. Multiple
paths are shown as capacitor like gaps in the broken band.
For tunneling probability of being zero in the avoided crossing, P = exp ( −2π 2 / 4υ ) = 0, or υ = 0. In a crossed parallel
pathway, the trapped charge, does not come from anywhere,

of singularity points in the phase space. This is similar to
a quantum system where we take the product of wave functions, not sum to represent a system. Functional groups in a
spiral array could act like a quantum antenna that reshapes
the electromagnetic wave input into a torus like a packet
of magnetic flux and explore how multiple antennas to be
placed in a 3D space so that their quantum coherence does
not de-phase. There are three key factors in the design of a
fourth-circuit element, H (Figure 8.4a–e). First, the barrier
heights of a quantum well depend on the quantity of stored
charge. If the height is increased, a trapped wave has to
reflect many more times between the walls before leaking
through. It is like adding a greater number of turns in a coil
increasing the magnetic flux. Second, to squeeze the density
of states of a quantum well within a narrow gap, the barriers
have different resonance frequencies around the Fermi level
of the well. As an electromagnetic wave passes through a
high-density region, it converts a part of its electric field
to the magnetic field so the emission is magnetic in nature
(electromagnetic lensing). Third, without wiring physically,
we place all quantum antennas in a 3D space on the path
where emission from a single well experiences a singularity at resonance. It enables an array of a quantum antenna

whatever few available already there, reflect back and
forth between E F1 and E F 2 , with an energy gap ∆ . During
repeated reflections, a charge remains occupied, one could
use an occupation function used by Esaki and Tsu in their
historical work in the 1980s,

8.2 FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL
PARAMETERS OF A FOURTHCIRCUIT ELEMENT—HINDUCTOR
Most magnetic field studies are performed by applying the field externally, here we are arguing that there is
a possibility to generate the magnetic field naturally, in
a non-magnetic material. Shaping the field using a quantum antenna is gaining interest as tiny antennas need to
be arranged in a geometry that looks like a superposition
of wave functions. At resonance, the product of the wave
functions of tiny antenna systems generates a path made

to produce a phase space identical to a single antenna.
Asymmetric quantum well means its barriers have different resonance levels, so, if the gap is reduced, the density
of states of the well is squeezed, the input electromagnetic
wave experiences a lensing effect. When the wave function
of the well’s density of states oscillates periodically, the
absorption of an external electromagnetic signal leads to a
rapid oscillation and emission of a coherent burst. Therein,
lensing ensures that the transverse component of the electric field contributes to the magnetic field. Consequently, in
the emitted wave, the magnetic vector dominates over the
electric vector. If we insert one such an asymmetric well
inside another, since, two squeezed levels act as the walls
of a non-physical quantum well, the lensing and the noise
filtering abilities increase manifold. The heights of the
walls not only quantify the charge content but also determine the number of times the rapidly oscillating waveform
would reflect between the walls before leaking through or
emission.
How does the necessity to survive under noise leads
to the nested capacitor and nested inductor: a precursor to a fractal network of resonators: Students are often
ask “why is it difficult to take out an electron from a solid?”
The teacher replies that an electron becomes a property of
the entire solid. Taking it out means snatching it alone from
all the neighboring atoms that make the solid. Similarly,
when the wave packets nest, the noise has to break the nesting, and dephasing a single wave won’t work. Thus, the nesting of waves does not have to be a quantum one, it could
be a classical nesting of waveforms. Fourth-circuit element
avoids dephasing not by silencing the noise, but by packing the phase of the constituent waveforms fractally while
arresting the electron flow critically—super non-conductivity could a new route to scale free integration of wave
functions under noise. The idea to arrest the waveforms
by manipulating a materials reflectance and transmittance
came in the 1980s when the concept of quantum capacitance (Luryi, 1988; Brown et al., 1989; Ilani et al., 2006)
and quantum inductance (Liu, 1991; Begliarbekov et al.,
2011; Asakawa, 2010; Wang et al., 2007) came into being.
The concept of reflectance and transmittance is very classical. Imagine there is a capacitor. Inside that capacitor there
is another pair of electrodes. Now the bigger host capacitor would lose a part of the transmitting wave to the small
capacitor. Some of the waves would get trapped by creating
a capacitor inside a capacitor. It could even be possible that
when the waves get trapped in the guest capacitor, a part of
it leaks. The leaked wave would be out of phase than the
input wave to the guest. so the out of phase wave would be
representing an inductor. Now, these nested capacitors and
inductors would be a quantum device if the trapped energy
levels are so closely spaced that the uncertainty in energy
comes into effect. Quantum or not, nesting of capacitors and
inductors make sure that there is a nesting of electronic resonators, and the cleverly designed array of resonant tunneling
diodes could turn the medium into a super-super-insulator,
by trap inside a trap inside a trap….

8.2.1 Periodically Oscillating Edge

Figure 8.4b describes three concentric coils, which is a fourthcircuit element. We take one of the coils in Figure 8.4c. If we
twist the coil, we get a screw (δ = 0;δ = π ; left-handed and
right-handed, respectively) and edge (δ = π /2 ) dislocations of
zig-zag paths on the coil surface. Since the coils are twisted,
a mixed screw and edge dislocations on the YZ plane of coil
surface rotates the X-axis by an angle δ , so that the YZ plane
turns after rotation by an angle δ , a precision is given by an

ω generates a high intensity of B lines. Since three layers
are identical, G-mode frequencies are very close, it triggers
beating, B knots get sharper. How electromagnetic wave
falls on the surface and creates interference is shown in
Figure 8.4g.

The B knots or magnetic free particle-like fields are output
of two interactions, internal clock and perturbation clock
(Figure 8.5a). The top cylindrical surface is a crystalline
dielectric, conventionally the Pancharatnam-Berry phase
of the electronic Bloch wavefunction represents the polarization (Resta, 1997). Here, the magnetic vectors interfere
with creating vortex atoms, or artificial structures, they
hold nested Hilbert space or polarization tensors in the
11D space. There is no electron flow, no hysteresis. A light
with an electric vector rotating around the propagation axis
develops an angular momentum, it is possible to change the

direction of rotation and thus execute phase transition. Many
years of research has led to a situation now, where, if the
rotating light rotates again in a loop path, it is possible that
multiple isolated loops interact and changes rotational direction, i.e., breaks polarization symmetry (Copie et al., 2019).
Fresnel refraction from surface reflect charge distribution,
Figure 8.5b shows charge distribution and optical reflection

Production of coherent and polarized signal from
noise: a saga of twisted spirals: Noise to polarized light conversion is known (Heebner et al., 2000). Cylindrical spiral is
a crystal, the diffracted electromagnetic signal does not originate from high electron density surface plasmons, but an
incredibly strong insulator. Electrons cannot move from one
site to another; they absorb noise depending on the cell configuration, but the energy they emit is quantized, thus monochromatic, or singular frequency. Most importantly, since
spirals are twisted, similar to thermal noise birefringence
(Reuter et al., 2012), the twist leads to an edge-screw defect
that creates a pair of plane-polarized signals from the cellular

emission. Consequently, conversion of noise to a plane polarized monochromatic signal by a material similar to an interferometer (Figure 8.5c) is a key here. We add inner and outer
coils to a central coil to perturb each other, interfere and
generate the dark lines. The interference between the central
coil and the inner coil is very different from the interference
between the central coil and the outer coil, since perturbation
angle α is negative and positive, respectively (Figure 8.4g).

for generating dynamic magnetic vortices is easy to generate. Here, H forms a broken band-like structure with two-cone

Birefringence and metamaterial: Optically or electromagnetically operating quantum devices can process quantum states at room temperature and in ambient atmospheric
conditions. However, it requires a pair of quantum coherent
sources, for interference. Microtubule has the property of
birefringence (Mithieux et al., 1985), which enables generating a pair of quantum coherent sources (O-ray and E ray;
Figure 8.3a). The α -helices of a protein molecule could be
considered as a single, the most elementary antenna. A protein molecule would itself be an optical antenna array,
whose optical anisotropy is tailored by mechanical resonance. Such materials normally show a giant birefringence
(Kats et al., 2012). Such a surface controls the polarization of

Due to a common wall between the coils, a coherence between
the bifurcated sources are ensured.
The basic requirement of GML is a clock. If three plane
waves interfere, we get a straight line, if four plane waves interfere, the vortices rotate like a clock Ψ (O’Holleren et al., 2006).
If five waves interfere, we get an irregular pattern. Each clock
Ψ holds a singularity point. Note that the geometric shapes

are inequality relationship hold by the clocks. For example,
Ψ1 + Ψ2 ≥ Ψ3… triangle. Ψ1 + Ψ2 + Ψ3 ≥ Ψ4 … quadrilateral.
Ψ1 + Ψ2 + Ψ3 + Ψ4 ≥ Ψ5 … pentagon. Different composition of
cross-bar pathways on the Hinductor coil forms magnetic rings
of different diameters representing Ψ1, Ψ2 , Ψ3 … These distinct rings could interact to integrate into a higher-level clock.

8.3.2

Pancharatnam Berry Phase

As described in Chapter 4, the concept of geometric phase
is easy to conceive if we consider microcoil or nano coil resonators and shine it with polarized light (Lee et al., 2011).
Since Hinductor is all about multilayer concentric columns,
adding geometric phase is easy. If noise is pumped along the
column of a spiral, the dominating magnetic flux morphs a
ring. If the noise is pumped on its surface (~23° for microtubule), the flux adopts a spiral shape. At resonance, as the

oscillate with noise. If the noise intensity V is within limits
(20 < V < 80 mV), ~500 times below the charging bias of a
capacitor and the frequency bandwidth of noise could hold
gv ( r ) number of resonance peaks, then the local magnetic
wave degeneracy is gv = gv ( r ) × gv ( a,b ) . Sahu et al. imaged a
pair of THz magnetic wave observed in a rectangular and in
a hexagonal lattice, but no current or field flow was observed.
Topology change rearranges the fields whose vector sum is
zero. Accumulation of magnetic flux is not from more current
flow by amperes law, but the adjustment of shined light on the
electron density surface.
The magnetic waves generated by splitting of noise
interfere due to the helical period experienced by a lattice
(a, b). The magnetic field could tune quantum beating (Henke
et al., 1981) in the microtubule and in its analog H device
∅ ~ gv ( ab )eiθ . As the frequency gap between the coherent
sources is low, a THz noise beats at GHz frequencies surviving
around a pair of lattice units. These GHz oscillations interfere
again θ ~ gvl eiω due to length, pitch, and diameter constraints, beat at MHz ( f 0 = ∆f = 0.0000001 THz ~1 MHz ),
surviving around thousands ofiωlattice units. The condensed
magnetic wave ∅ ~ gv( ab )eigvl e
is imaged live, two-level
magnetic interference integrates a local lattice to its global
topology. Waves couple classically by adding/subtracting
phase, quantum phases couple as a product, but here, in the
beating of beats, the phases couple exponentially. A pair of
microtubules synchronously beats at multiple time scales at a
time, due to the beating of beats. The difference in frequency
of participating waves is the beating frequency of a new wave,
but that wave could undergo beating once again.

8.3.3 Pyroelectric, Ferroelectric, and
Piezoelectric Properties
Biological materials are often depicted as ferroelectric
and piezoelectric since under a mechanical pressure they
release ions as current flow, and at a suitable electric bias
desorb/absorb ion reversibly. A true ferroelectric material
should have an intimate correlation between the applied
bias and its dipolar orientations, flowing current under
pressure and reversible conductance switching are not sufficient. Bandyopadhyay et al. have imaged live the resonant oscillations of DNA, RNA, proteins like actin and
their complexes via tunneling current, which show that
unlike inorganic materials, these are soft like a liquid drop.
The concept of “lattice-like ordering of dipoles” or even a
“domain of unidirectional dipoles” does not exist therein.
Porcine brain neuron-extracted tubulin has 8 tryptophan
and 36 tyrosine residues (Ponstingl et al., 1982), and as the
temperature increases, a smaller number of tryptophan residues are exposed. Denaturalization via unfolding has two
linear domains, first 20°C–40°C and second, 55°C–90°C,
in these regions, a conformational change is homogeneous
(Mozo-Villarias et al., 1991). The interesting transition at
40°C–55°C is caused by the conversion of just one tryptophan residue from exposed to the unexposed configuration.

Since this transition stops reversible switching of the tubulin charge center by 1.2Å, dipolar switching by ±23° is
blocked, and tubulin is left with only one energy minima,
tubulin switches from two energy minima to one; therefore,
microtubules Curie point should be located here. In the
20°C–40°C domain, both tryptophan and tyrosine residues
change conformation and unfold in the same rate; however,
in the 55°C–90°C region, tryptophan residues denaturize faster than tyrosine residues, and at >55°C, less than 4
tryptophans remain exposed, at 90°, tubulin is permanently
denaturized (Audenaert et al., 1989). The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images of multiple structural phases
of single tubulin dimer; these transitions were artificially
induced in the structure in a controlled manner.
Similarly, a structural phase transition occurs in the microtubule lattices as observed in the cryo-TEM where rectangular
to hexagonal lattice transition is visible in the microtubules in
the neuron (Kikkawa et al., 1994). Porcine tubulins assemble
into microtubule via distorted hexagonal close packing with
a unique polar direction which assigns lattice-type A to enantiomorphic polar crystal class (point group C6) and latticetype B pure polar class (point group C6V). Both the lattices
favor a spontaneous pyroelectric and ferroelectric effect (Wu
et al., 2009; Bruce et al., 2011), notably, out of 32, only 10
polar crystal classes favor these effects.
Effective electronic polarization co-efficient or the
ionic polarizability α normalized for microtubule length is
6.3 ± 0.3 × 10 −24 cm (Minoura and Muto, 2006; microtubule
has 10% of the value of BaTiO3), charge density is 20 e/dimer,
2.5 e/nm along one protofilament, hence 32 e/nm in a 13 protofilament microtubule. Hence, polarization measurement
should start after all these charges are released; otherwise,
we see clockwise current-voltage characteristic. For a true
ferroelectric, polarization in hysteresis is counter-clockwise.
A single microtubule’s perfectly square or lossless hysteric
current-voltage (IV) characteristic at 10 −6Torr and in ambient conditions depicts a ferroelectric behavior, since remnant
polarization Prem sends leakage current at zero bias; red arrow
denotes threshold switching voltage. Microtubule showed
Prem~3 C/cm2, which is 106 times more than normal ferroelectrics; however, it is feasible since microtubule charge density
1020/cm3 is orders higher than normal insulator ferroelectrics.
For Prem coercive field is 0.6 kV/cm. Similar to a classical ferroelectric, microtubule holds the charge (ΔC/C) until Curie
temperature, and dielectric loss measurement supports the
inherent dipolar transition.

From magnetic rings, one could measure the total flux content Ψ by matching the ring’s color intensity with a standard
magnet response and plotted Ψ with Q. Both Ψ and Q varied non-linearly as a function of applied frequency ω but so
similarly that the Ψ-Q plots were linear, for all materials studied, delivering a constant H, which is accurately predicted by
equation (8.10). H is oscillatory as a function of L, P, and D, if
the periods for a typical material are L p, Pp, and Dp , then the
periodicity index I = L p Pp /π D p2. In fact, Γi ( r, t ) explained in
equation (8.9) that governs H3 and the generalized expression for Hinductance, H (equation 8.10), was discovered in
>1000 devices by three independent blind studies (Karthik,
K.V., Suryakant, Kumar, Pushpendra Singh) spanned over ten
years. However, though the dimensions are same, H is not the
resistance as its value is ~10 −4, while the resistance of these
devices R is ~109 Ω, these devices are all insulators, i.e., no
current flows.
The interaction between the electromagnetic field and
the quantum system is characterized by another constant,
the charge, that pertains to the quantum system alone. If we
look closely into the quantum analogs of classical devices,
most quantum formulations do three things. First it considers that even quantum elements follow classical circuit
wiring concepts, serial and parallel connections of circuit
elements are only two ways to connect them. Second, it considers that a very low resistance path and low conductance
fluctuation around Fermi level (hυ = k BT ) is the only way
to realize a quantum effect. Always, I and V are there as
a common factor with Ψ or Q ; it is believed Ψ − Q pair
cannot stand alone. Third, entanglement does not require a
real physical communication through a well-defined path,

233

yet it considers a coherent real physical motion of particles
within an isolated restricted barrier to avoid the dephasing.
Be it a spin-wave or quantum interference, a path is always
there, but never there in theory. Three legacies of classical concepts, classical wiring, resistance, and necessity of
a defined path, were universally accepted in the quantum
experiments and their quantum transformations were never
in demand. It is utmost essential not to copy the classical
treatments in quantum and also demonstrate that the effort
to standalone Ψ − Q pair as independent as resistance could
have a classical analog too.
Conductance, a differential of current and voltage
was earlier defined as dI ⁄dV , now as R → ∞, d Ψ⁄dQ → 0.
Quantum formulations inherently consider d Ψ⁄dQ = R. It is
not always true. If d Ψ⁄dQ ≠ R, and undefined, then a new
formulations quantum mechanics and classical mechanics
are required. Since we do not supply voltage and measure
current anymore, the existing formulations, all based on
conductance requires a new equivalent. Similar to dI ⁄dV ,
differential conductance we get dQ ⁄d Ψ, while the first flow
electron, the second flows phase. Since R → ∞, R = 1015 Ω
and H = 0.001, dQ ⁄d Ψ ≠ dI ⁄dV . We need a new physical
parameter. The newly invented probe that senses the differential flux-charge, only applies noise. The noise, within
a limit lets the clocking continue within the well. Beyond
that, the noise shortens the clocking circle’s perimeter such
that the electromagnetic wave turns smaller than the barrier’s collision cross-section that reflects it, the wave leaks
through the well barrier. Information processing in microtubule was proposed in 1982 (Hameroff and Watt, 1982)
experimentally verified in 2010 (Sahu et al., 2010, 2013a,
2013b).

8.4.1 Flow of Thermal Wave—Friend or Foe?
In manmade machines, friction/collision is essential to apply
the torque to move a body to work, which causes the heatloss—consequently, scientists argued a loss-less Carnot
engine (Carnot and Thurston, 1890) for nearly half a century.
Simply put, the target is to send energy from source to drain
without any loss. Recently, the dream is explored via quantum
protocols (Scully et al., 2003; del Rio et al., 2011) arguing that
the quantum coherence would enable loss-less transmission
and entanglement would avoid friction in a machine. Since
these models keep the century-old “isolated system”—a hallmark of Kelvin’s thermodynamic era, the energy-loss is inevitable when the work is translated outside. Landauer argued
that the minimum energy required for one computational step
in an “open system” is kBT and it could be realized using a
loss-less particle-like energy-packet (Landauer, 1988) for the
source-to-drain transport. Since, a Kinesin motor requires
12 kBT per step to walk through microtubule in a living
cell or “non-isolated” system, the random fluctuations even
by one kBT unit would cause ~10% error, which living cells
cannot afford. Both, the engine efficiency of Kinesin cycle
that varies from 0% to 100%, and the variation of growth/
decay of microtubule-length with temperature have argued

234

microtubule as an ideal heat sink (Caplow et al., 1988). Since
microtubule exhibits negative specific heat (Vulevic and
Correia, 1997), the possibility cannot be ruled out. Moreover,
the noise-induced errors are fatal to the essential vesicle transport in a living cell—alleviated if microtubule is a perfect
heat sink that keeps the entropy constant even under thermal
fluctuations.
The lattice mosaic of tubulin proteins on the microtubule surface works as the nesting ground for a stream of
loss-less particle-like energy packets. Chemical imbalance
triggers soliton in the β-sheet of protein (Kayser et al.,
2004). Solitons also generate in the zig-zag chain like
α -helix, microtubule surface (Christiansen et al., 1997).
Helical nanowires generate solitons (Brizhika et al., 2006).
Microtubule satisfies all these criteria, surface-bound states
generate topological phonon modes (Prodan and Prodan,
2009). Live images are shown, how feedback management
operates to balance the thermal noise and the signal collectively to keep the entropy constant between 5 and 320 K.
The finding resolves the thermodynamic equilibrium
debate by showing that the fluctuation in protein-entropy is
the signature of feedback management to keep the entropy
constant. We could not read the random-jumps in entropy,
so we assigned it as noise. The Carnot engine equivalence
of a single brain microtubule is derived here from direct
microscopic visualization.
Dynamics of two tubulin dimers suggest that the oscillation of energy between two dimers do not stop even in the
presence of a neighbor, therefore, the mechanical energy
stored in the extra β-sheet of tubulin dimer cannot move
alone. However, when tubulins form a nearly a ring, mechanical oscillation stabilizes. Thus, 13 tubulin dimers can disperse energy homogeneously only long the circumference of
the microtubule, a concerted shift of lattice displacement is
created along a circular region as a ring of energy-packets
with an opening due to offset. Spiral symmetry of microtubule makes β -sheets forming spiral inside a spiral of tubulin
dimers (Hunyadi et al., 2007). A helical structure naturally
quantizes energy that transmits through it (Michalski and
Mele, 2000). Helical structures also trigger ballistic transport (Grigorkin and Dunaevskii, 2007). The opening destabilizes the 13-tubulin ring to move longitudinally along
the length of the microtubule, and nanocavities are known
to generate ballistic phonon (Huang et al., 2009). This ring
with an opening is a phonon-particle like energy packet,
since it is visible distinctly in AFM images, but not in the
STM image. Due to identical periodic paths, since creation,
the relative coordinates of electronic-packets and phononphonon packets are automatically fixed on the microtubule
surface, which locks phase and frequency of the constituent
phonon- and electronic-packets locally. Thus phonon-packets
move together linearly and electronic-packets move together
helically as a single unit, and we call it group. Since these
particle-like energy-packets are lattice kinks, they are visible in AFM if mechanical in nature and visible in STM if
electronic. Filaments, in general, create a topological phonon
mode (Berg et al., 2011).

Nanobrain

The mixture of five electronic-particle groups of distinct symmetries and three phonon-particle groups of distinct periodicities appear and disappear on the microtubule
surface during transport under thermal scan 5–320 K.
Simultaneously, one should measure electronic-particle and
phonon-particle covered area on the microtubule surface
from live images. The ratio of these two areas or fraction of
surface area covered by phonon-particle and electronic-particle groups is termed as the band fill factor, and the coherence
reflects mutual co-operation between two kinds of particles
and lattice distortions (Moskalenko et al., 1980). These
deformations shrink/expand separation between protein
dimers throughout the nanowire; thus, restricts the length
and conductivity of the microtubule-spring (σE ). The microtubule length, group-phase transition frequency and the rate
of length change are proportional to the externally applied
noise. Since, after reaching the far end, the phonon-particles
are pumped out as energy, they disappear from the image,
surplus/deficit of phonon-particle groups subtract/add the
length of microtubule nanowire, to which electronic-particle
groups respond again and return conductivity back to the
initial one (σ S to σ E ). Thus, the surface coverage of electronic-particle and phonon-particle groups is regulated in a
quantized manner, and similar to a spring a feedback control
returns original length and conductivity.
To calculate entropy, Sahu et al. wrote a conducting state
(σ E ) at a particular temperature and by sweeping the temperature between 5 and 320 K continuously measured the
conductivity. The dc and ac conductivity remains constant,
except minor jumps between equally spaced values (σ S ).
Even under extreme thermal noise is 1 K/minute (dQ), oscillatory flipping between two limiting conductivities is observed
as temperature T changes. The entropy S = S 0 +  dσ S /T 
plot against temperature T shows that it remains constant
over time, no material is known to exhibit such feature under
normal condition (Zaitsevzotov, 1993). When the entropy
slips, noise is poured into the microtubule and when entropy
returns it means, the noise is pumped out of microtubule.
Thus, the microtubule sets a classic example of harnessing
noise to keep the entropy constant; it demonstrates transport
and noise-alleviation efficiency at an extreme level. The output noise current is a function of source-drain and gate bias.
Here, a harmonic interference of noise propagating along the
microtubule, and when there it is no noise, these are the live
images of how microtubule manages noise. STM and AFM
images of energy-packet transmission and interference like
pattern proves that the transmitted signal across microtubule
is coherent, microtubule converts incoherent signals into a
coherent wave.

8.4.2 Wireless Communication between
Two H Devices
Magnetic coupling carries out wireless energy transfer much
more easily than electromagnetic or electric coupling (Kurs
et al., 2007) if there is a parity-time symmetric circuit then the
power transfer is even more robust (Assawaworrarit et al., 2017).

oscillations (nine ripples noted) when magnetic-charge differential measured directly by coaxial atom probe is plotted against magnetic
flux. Inset is the length variation study of microtubule and finding periods of oscillations for different lengths. Inset plot was used to calculate fermi velocity of charge.

Magneto-inductive effects in the metamaterials allow even
1D data transfer (Stevens et al., 2010). Saxena et al. have
carried out an extensive study on wireless communication between the pair of microtubules (Saxena et al., 2018;
Figure 8.8a–c). Microtubule undergoes rapid phase changes
on its surface under the exposure of electromagnetic fields
of certain frequencies (Sahu et al., 2010). We can consider
its surface as a composition of lattices of various lattice
parameters and sizes, and all experiments are carried out
by mixing noise with signal (noise>2signal; Figure 8.8b).
At a ­particular resonance frequency, there is an equilibrium, we get N requ = N 0exp − ∆Gcluster ( r ) k BT , this statistically accounts the composition of lattice symmetries at
resonance, where

(

∆Gcluster ( r ) = −∆Glc, v .π r 2lcluster + σπ r 2lmicrotubule …

(8.11)

Here, ∆Glc,v is the energy due to a phase change per unit cluster area on the microtubule or H surface. And σ is the interfacial free energy propagating throughout the microtubule
surface due to THz transmissions between tubulin proteins or
equivalent capacitors.
From equation (8.11) we get ∆Gcritical = 16πσ 3 3∆Glc, v 2 for
a particular lattice configuration, i.e., greater than a critical
radius, and equation (8.11) predicts a condensation above this
limit. Condensation means a particular lattice starts dominating its surface. The rate of condensation of a typical symmetry in a receiver microtubule’s surface is given by

(8.12)

Here, N c is the number of lattice points that first synchronizes
its phase in the sender with the receiver’s magnetic condensed
wave’s phase. Now, we need to find the phase gain rate gs from
the lattice gain rate G. We explain it below.
To understand the wireless communication between the
microtubule analog devices as shown in Figure 8.8d, we
inherently considered the coupled-mode theory model of two
resonant systems for the analysis. According to this coupledmode theory, these two resonant systems act as a source and
receiver. The source system has a resonant frequency of ωs.
The overall system gain rate is expressed as G = g s − γ s , where
g s is the phase gain rate of the source and γ s is the intrinsic loss rate of the source. The receiver lattice has a resonant frequency of ωr. The overall loss rate of the system is
expressed as the γ = γ r + γ rl, where γ r is the intrinsic loss rate
of the receiver and γ rl is the rate of loss at the receiver load.
Power is transmitted from source to receiver with a transmission coupling coefficient rate α , which is a function of signal
amplitude. Transmission coupling coefficient decreases exponentially as the separation distance between the source and
receiver increases (Figure 8.8e). Here Saxena et al. supplied
noise signal to the source. If Vnoise is the noise signal and Vr
is the output voltage of receiver, then the rate of change in
signals is described by the following equation:

8.4.3 Tomasch Oscillations and Harvesting Noise
Now, it’s time to test noise on a single microtubule. We all could
remember the historical journey that Tomasch oscillations or
reflections in the same direction made (Tomasch, 1966; Lykken
et al., 1970; Wolfram, 1968). If the path is resistance-less, then
the carriers do not leave a thin, confined region, oscillates therein
between the boundaries for a long time. Of course, in the initial
days, finding the evidence of such trapped oscillation (Tomasch
oscillation) became difficult. However, one particular point
became explicit—the device geometry does play a role in the
prolonged survival of a carrier in the thin confined region. Now,
a long time has passed, people are trying to change from electron
flow to the phase flow, and for that, the device geometry would
become ever more critical (Thouless, 1998). Every clock is like a
pendulum, repeatedly reflects between the two boundaries. Here,
we have an unusual situation. No one would like that the network of clocks would damp. One way to resolve that problem is
to vibrate the boundary of the cavity. That vibration would supply the necessary energy required to run the clock. Say, we want
an electron to be trapped in a cavity and then vibrate between
the boundaries for a long, long time so that it represents a clock.
Differential flux charge measurement on a single microtubule
shows Tomasch oscillations (Figure 8.8f).

8.5 PERIODIC OSCILLATION OF
CAPACITANCE, INDUCTANCE, AND
HINDUCTANCE WITH ITS GEOMETRY
Quantum resonance made of quantum inductor and
quantum capacitor: Violation of Kirchhoff’s law: Since
the first observation of resonance by inductive and capacitive
elements in 1826, whenever we observe resonance in nature,
deep inside our brain to the extreme end of the galaxy, it has
become a customary to consider a hidden pair of capacitor and
inductor inside. In the 1990s, the quantum versions of these
pairs arrived as a quantum capacitor and quantum inductor,
now we wire them classically to find the quantum resonance.
It is astonishing, since the violation of Kirchhoff’s law was
proposed in the 1960s, that the current-times-resistance of
all the elements in a closed loop must equal zero, if not, for
example, emission by any element, the time-varying magnetic field generating additional input, then the law violates.
Most importantly, if there is a device architecture in which
there is a device inside a device, or the escape time fractallike hardware—the central hallmark of this book, again the
Kirchhoff law would be violated.
How to emulate coherent emission It is shown now that if
we wire the quantum elements in series or parallel, the conductances do not add up (Gabelli et al., 2006). The culture of
obtaining the resonance frequencies by a linearly wired resistor, capacitor, and inductor still continue. Since in a quantum
inductor, a magnetic flux generates by reflection and not by
current flow, and in a quantum capacitor forms without storing a real charge, both the magnetic flux and the charge were
neither quantified nor detected. These quantum elements
originate in the quantum well embedded inside a classical
capacitor, not alone, as an original device. In the quantum
well, a wave function not only interacts with the input electromagnetic wave (Aharonov and Bohm, 1959), but also emits
entangled photons at room temperature (Michler et al., 2000),
the effect of magnetic and electric dipoles are explicitly distinguished in the interference pattern (Freed and Weissman,
1941). In a quantum well, even the physical oscillation of a
trapped charge could repeatedly emit coherent quantum
bursts of infra-red surviving longer than picoseconds (Roskos
et al., 1992). Remarkably, a superlattice of quantum wells is
more stable in the coherent emission for both electromagnetic
(Waschke et al., 1993) and magnetic spin wave (Oh et al.,
2017). It promises designing an array of quantum antenna
that could shape how the emitted ripple would look like. Until
now, enhancing magnetic emission by suppressing the electrical emission was achieved by introducing a pseudo level
(Karaveli and Zia, 2010). Advancing further, if the oscillating
charge of a quantum well could reshape the electromagnetic
wave into a packet of coherent magnetic flux, then a wireless burst of magnetic ripple could flow like a photon through
the medium or even vacuum. An extreme environment would
not be required to run the quantum coherent circuits. One
would not require to build a parallel, or series wiring of quantum device. The quantum elements could float at proper orientation at the coordinates so that all the participating circuit

237

Hinductor Not Memristor—Synthesis of Atoms and Crystals Made of Magnetic Light

elements build a combined phase space. An integrated chip
would look like a 3D geometric shape where no current flows.
The route is unique among all existing proposals to survive
quantum effects in an ambient condition since it suggests
rearranging the classical environment as a unique topology of
quantum’s infinite choices requires.
An electrical charge cannot flow since we want the
­magnetic vortex atom to flow as pure evidence, a solution
to such critical demand were made in the 1990s. Increasing
the dwell time of an electromagnetic wave in a well could
mean the storage of charge like a capacitor Cq and if the
wave repeatedly reflects between the walls of a potential
well could generate a circular current flow like an inductor Lq . These are not normal capacitor and inductor, and the
origin is not geometry but discrete energy levels of a material. In order to satisfy Dirac’s criterion, the unique potential well acting as Lq and Cq should act as an antenna that
would radiate a magnetic ring or torus outside the potential
well. For that to happen, the height of the potential wells
should vary, not directly with the real charge but a parameter that controls the dwell time of an electromagnetic
wave trapped in a potential well, obviously, it is frequency.
Unfortunately, the wall parameters of quantum wells are
fixed as soon as it is fabricated, so we need to design a virtual quantum well just like the concept of an artificial molecule was engineered.
The height and width of the walls of the virtual well made
of charge varies alone to regulate the emission of classical or
quantum rings of magnetic flux. That is why single microtubule’s capacitance oscillates as a function of length, pitch
and diameter (Figure 8.9a–c). Does the storage of charges
change the spiral? In order to find an answer, we calculated
quantum capacitance, Cq = ∂Q ∂V = ∂Q ∂ψ . We solve
equation (8.15) to find the expression of quantum capacitance
of the system,

When Cq is measured using a differential bridge circuit;
the theory is found consistent with the experimental result.
The actual charge stored in the wall could be measured using
Cq directly. Using a semiconductor electron emitter we injection charge to the protein and applied nT range magnetic flux,
we could not change the flux density image. The ring and spirals are not made of charge or spin, as conventional magnetic
fields are defined. The effective mass of the massive carriers
trapped in the lattice cells was measured experimentally on
the single microtubule and experimental data provides clear
evidence that the effective mass increases as we trap more
(Figure 8.9d).
In order to confirm that the emitted magnetic flux is truly
ring-shaped, first we consider that there is truly a ring, on its
perimeter at any point, ψ ( t ) = ψ sinφ ; then due to the quantization of a circular path φ = Φ2π0 Q, where Φ 0 is the magnetic

flux quantum in the ring, we get the quantum inductance
Lq = 2Φπ 0Q cos1 φ . Then, from the density of states, we recalcu2
late quantum inductance Lq = 12πhq2Γ . Both the expressions of
L
quantum inductance calculated from the density of states and
ring topology give the same value which suggests that there
is truly a ring and it originates in the virtual quantum well.
Also, since in a generic quantum well Lq =  / 2ΓG, earlier,
conductance G was related to current flow, here a comparison shows G = ∂Q / ∂ψ . The finding suggests a new paradigm of transmitting energy as rings of magnetic flux, which
experiences a new kind of resistance, primarily topological.
By arranging seeded quantum wells in a particular geometry in the 3D space filled with extremely insulating matrix
( R = ∞ ) one could build artificially integrated chips of nonelectronics, where another resistance is H = 0.001. Quantum
conductance and quantum inductance were measured on a
single microtubule (Figure 8.9e, f), which showed that not just
one, single microtubule exhibits multiple such values, and
one could regulate or tune those values using simple control
parameters. The measuring device is shown in Figure 8.9g.
It seems beyond electronics we may have an era of super nonconductivity (Figure 8.9h).

8.5.1 The Concept of Phase Space
with 12 Holes That Blink
Twelve singularities of combined phase space: Opening
and closing the undefined holes on the phase sphere:

The wave ψ mag from Ω number of cells interfere, the
boundaries set by D, P, L, and ab adds wave functions
from three directions 3 ∑i cosxi and takes a product from
4
two directions (D, L) with a feedback effect ( ∏i cosxi ) .
Ω3 Γ r , t
So, we get the number of reflections Ψ ~ τ e i ( ) / cm .
That equates a delay τ (~ ∆Q, delay=charge, no real electron storage) with the magnetic flux produced, hence
Ω3 Γ i ( r , t )
H = ∆Ψ
/ cm . Oscillating L, P, D, and ab delivers the
∆Q = e
phase factor Γi ( r , t ) = 3 ∑i cos ( xi costi ) + 4 ∏i cos ( xi costi ) ;
xi is replaced by the geometric parameters. In a Hinductor
device or H, the phase sphere an equivalent to the Hilbert
space of a qubit has 12 singularities. It means it has 12
holes on the sphere (Figure 8.9i, j). There are a pair of singularities for all six x, y, z, xy, yz, zx directions, so we get
12 holes. The generic function that regulates the solutions
is given by 3 ∑i cosθi + 4 ∏i cosθi . However, there is a temporal function added to the angular values in this function
cosρ1cosρ2cos ( ρ3 sin t ), or cos ( ρi sin t ) . When discrete magnetic rings Ψ1, Ψ 2 , Ψ 3 … holding a geometric shape change the
diameter, actually on the phase space the holes of singularity
change their diameter. It is a beautiful life-like event. As electric field clocks the magnetic ring, the solid angle ρi created
by phase singularity oscillates as a function of time ρi sin t ,
but we can add 1–12 temporal functions in ( 2n − 1) ~ 4 × 103
ways. Thus, a fundamental Hinductor device carries out 4047
distinct temporal dynamics. A maximum of 12 vertices solid
3D topology it can represent, e.g., hexagonal prism, icosahedron, triangular bifrustum, truncated tetrahedron, etc. If

parameters, length, pitch, diameter, it is time to dig deeper.
Figure 8.10 shows three plots, microtubule’s, resonance frequencies, H and stored charge variation as a function of geometric parameters. The plots show that Tomasch oscillation
like periodic changes is a universal feature of charge-magnetic
flux response of a device. The periodic oscillation means for
charge-flux operating particles, or magnetic rings or magnetic vortices, the extreme insulated cylinder acts as an H-less
device. Thus, we could now sum-up basic arguments why H
might claim to be a fourth-circuit element (Figure 8.11a).
In the quantum model of the fourth-circuit element device,
namely microtubule, a pair of α-helices of a tubulin protein molecule forms a quantum well, a different number of coils of an
α-helix act as asymmetric barriers (n = 4, 7.8 cm−1, 12.4 cm−1).
The water molecules between a pair of helices generate a pair
of shallow, deep quantum well. Water’s quantum well is the
guest in the host α-helix quantum well. Vibrational frequencies of water and helices are calculated by DFT for n = 4 and

n = 2 loops and 12 water molecules in between. Depending
on the type of protein and its concerned group of α-helices,
the values of squeezed states change. The Schrödinger’s equation for an arbitrary non-stationary state of the

An infra-red sensing nanowire and a magnetic flux sensing
nanowire located at the tip of an atomic resolution probe is
brought to the atomic scale vicinity of the protein, simultaneously detects this phase in two independent signals, one electromagnetic and another, magnetic. Instead of interferometric
detection of coherent infrared emission, or electro-optic gating, Ghosh et al.’s dual-mode nano-sensor remains a ~4 nm
apart from the emission center, by reducing detection energy
to 10 μV from 10 meV, fit to sense coherent burst 1–2 ps
(10 −12 seconds); and magnetic flux sensitivity (nT to 0.1 pT).
Measuring the magnetic flux of an electromagnetic burst is
critical since M-field is 104 times less than E-field at the sensor (Burresi et al., 2009). They detect M-field because it is
a magnetic ring that resonates with the magnetic nanowire.
Often the microtubule boundary is such that the waveforms
do not end at boundary, the vibration around boundary is such
that effective waveform is much longer (Figure 8.11d).
The oscillatory part of the magnetic flux is calculated by
considering a geometric series of amplitude t, which changes

due to a repeated reflection of ψ Osci between the two walls
of a virtual well. In the geometric series of t the number of
higher-order terms we consider is proportional to the height
of the virtual well, i.e., a function of stored charge (Karaveli
and Zia, 2010).

or radiated part ψ Osci (2), hence we get ψ Osci ∝ cos (ωt − α )
experimentally. The comprehensive match between (2) with

 
emitted all around the 3D structure as ψ Osciψ Osci * = ρ ( q, t ) ,
there are four primary and four minor quantum wells in a
monomer as estimated by quantum tunneling measurement of
the local charge density of states.
An extreme insulator, microtubule’s resonant oscillations are topologically similar to its constituent protein
tubulin’s resonance band, which are also extreme insulators. They all could be switched to a super non-conducting
state simply by applying noise. By constructing a special
coaxial atom probe, one could detect thermal and magnetic flux signals simultaneously. It has been observed that
the pairs of quantum capacitance and quantum inductance
generate geometric resonances in a single brain extracted
microtubule. Microtubules magnetic phase nests its dimers
phase that nests its monomer’s phase, a grouping of atomicscale waves continues to form larger waves is neither seen
in classical nor in quantum (Figure 8.11c). So, we can neither take a product of monomers wave functions to generate
the wave function of a microtubule nor can we use existing
quantum formulations as is. The super non-conductor generates a giant quantum magnetic flux like a superconductor
(Figure 8.11f).

8.5.3 Knots of Darkness on the H Interface
In order to confirm the formation of knots of darkness on an H
surface, the protein surface was scanned using the magnetic
nanowire, and the formation of magnetic spiral in the monomer was confirmed (Vignolini et al., 2010; Figure 8.11f).
The confirmation continued when the monomer forms a
dimer and even when it makes a giant protein complex.
The measurement was repeated for tubulin protein, actin, and
clathrin and checked for the non-existence of such behavior
in a single-walled carbon nanotube, but present in a helical
multiwalled carbon nanotube. Magnetic fields are reported in
many biomaterials, often this is due to magnetic materials.
What magnetic features we observe in fourth-circuit element
or by synthesis of light do not require any magnetic material

is a 3D spiral connecting the localized phase singularities on an
oscillating sphere. This spatial structure is carried by a light like
signal (E<<B). The plot of these distributions is a spiral connecting the localized phase singularities, if other quantum elements are placed on the stationary state solutions locate on this
path, it will contribute to the Hilbert space as a singular solution.

From the above expression of ψ Osci ( i, j , k ), we get the equation of a circle when E = E R, thus, we derive the formation of
a ring of magnetic flux, by two independent theoretical formulations. First formulation deals, when a shot noise <ωc > is
absorbed into quantum oscillations ρ ( q, t ) . Second formulation deals, when the virtual well is pumped with its resonance
frequency. All along the spiral path of the magnetic flux, the
measuring nanowire senses a quantized increment of flux, as
the system is charged with a photo-induced electron emitter;
thus, Ψ = HQ has both, a classical and a quantum version. To
underpin the lensing effect, Sahu et al. measured the density
of states for alpha-helix well and water well; one has to read
d 2 I /dV 2 and d 2Q/d Ψ 2, which shows that the magnetic density
of states is at the boundary of the electromagnetic density of
states. By de-phasing during a scan using noise, we track the
diffusion o of magnetic flux. Thus, the ring is made of electromagnetic wave wherein E  B , it is classical if Γω  1.
Proteins do exhibit quantum effects at room temperature, under
massive noise. However, here, the concerns of de-phasing by
scattering do not exist. It is all about the topological 3D orientation of quantum wells on the surface of a 3D phase sphere, as
cos α regulates not just the basic ring formation, but, stabilization by assembling the rings in a spiral form. Not just tubulin,
actin, all the proteins whose beta-sheet forms a spiral at the
backbone, may exhibit flux-ring condensed wave.

8.6 THREE INTERACTIVE CYLINDERS
PERTURBING THE KNOTS
At least three concentric cylinders is a unique engineering
feature of Hinductor. Multilayer coils enhance wireless transmission (Nair and Choi, 2016). Each layer generates distinct
waves, the inner coil ki*, and outer coil ko*, both 180° out of phase
sources perturb the central coil’s straight stationary dark line,
Dc , with wave vector kc* at an angle α and build singularity
structures Di and Do respectively. Dc, Di, and Do are identical
dark lines, differ by diameter alone, and hence trigger beating. We plot beat pattern. The dark lines interact depending

on the polarization. The dark lines ( Et = ( E x , E y ) = 0 ) form
when the real parts of propagating* signal kr′e i (θ ′+ζ ) and the two
*
i ( k . r −ω t )
perturbation signals from e1 ( e1e
) and e2 ( e2e i ( k .r −ωt + ∆ ) )
generated by the central coil’s screw and edge dislocations
cancel each other. Different zig-zag paths generate distinct
pairs of e1 and e2. We express e1 and e2 as e = (e1 + e2 )/ 2 that
represents total strength of perturbation and ∆e = (e2 − e1 )/2
that represents polarization ( E x ≠ E y ). Interactions of dark
lines could change e1 and e2, they could make a circle, or
ellipse or even magnetic rings or vortices (Figure 8.12a, b).

start with three concentric layer cylinders, S1 falls on the top
spiral, creates two coherent sources (Figure 8.12c). One part
S2 again creates a pair of coherent sources at the junction of
second and third spiral (Figure 8.12c). The critical condition
that creates magnetic particles is squeezing the first knot of
darkness, if we squeeze more by changing ∆e . These free
magnetic particles could rotate clockwise or anticlockwise
(Figure 8.12c). The coherent sources created by S1, S2, and
S3 interfere and generate composition of patterns of magnetic vortex on the cylindrical surface (Figure 8.12d). When
wave functions of two simultaneous situations created by
S1–S2 and S2–S3 are superposed and that builds the unit
time crystal (Figure 8.12e).
Generalized orbital angular momentum generation and Holographic projection of time crystal as a set
of orbital angular momentum set: Spiral dark lines, randomly arranged in the 3D space, were theoretically predicted by D ( s, θ ′ ) and routinely observed for four decades.
Now the same spirals with modified OAM contain the
coupling coefficients CCi and the wave vectors of distinct
G-mode frequencies. Here at ω triggered G-mode resonance, the induced ∆e varies periodically ∆e = sin δ , then
angle ∝ switches sign periodically, the dark knots assemble in a singular pattern of topological charge l = il1 + jl2 ,

parameters of a helix are responsible for the phase singularity
or phase discontinuity (Huang et al., 2013a, 2013b). In case the
surface has a metamaterial property, anisotropic transmission of
electromagnetic signals along the surface enables out of plane
reflection and refraction of light (Aieta et al., 2012). One of the
most exciting parts about this phase singularity or phase discontinuity is that it is dispersion-less, which means, one the propagating light build up a singularity, that angle would not change
while passing through the material (Huang et al., 2012).

angle α and build singularity structures Di and Do, respectively.
Inner and outer coils are internal and external mirrors, act
as a pair of 180° out of phase sources, thus, fit to edit perturbation phase 0°–180° and 180° to 360°. Splitting of light
into the isolated optical and magnetic vortex is achieved by
tuning α, to do that the relative position of inner and outer
coil shifts with respect to the central one. Three concentric spiral cylinders are in contact via yz plane, hence, k *
lies in the yz plane making an angle α with Oz, sign positive toward Oy, we can simplify above equations k1 = 0,
k2′ = ksin (δ + α ), k3′ = k cos (α + δ ) and from this identity

we get ( kr′ ) = ( e1 cos ( s ) ) + ( e2 sin ( s + ∆ ) ) , which gives r′,

but at 633 nm a mismatch makes the system unstable and subtle changes in the magnetic vortices are distinctly reflected.
Output magnetic vortex is projected on two types of films, Ni

(>2 hours) changes the film color, bright rings map a 2D slice
of the 3D magnetic vortex. The separation between the magnetic and optical vortex 5 m away from the sample is around
15 cm, it depends on the angular relation between reflector,
sample and vortex lens. On the sample we shone ω using a
Yagi antenna and estimated the stored charge Q on the surface
and magnetic flux on the film as a function of L, D, P, and ab
by two separate experiments. The change in capacitance with
the voltage at different ac frequencies gives Q.

Nature of harvested pure magnetic flux from light depends on
the angle ∝ made by perturbation wave from the inner and
outer coil. At ∝< 0, average intensity e and polarization ∆e
both should be high (~2), to create a ring of electrical null, that
is a magnetic ring along with hairpin-like electrical singular
ity or magnetic structures ψ mag . At ∝> 0, even if there is no
polarization ( ∆e = 0 ) , even a low-intensity signal ( e ~ 1), generates a ripple-like magnetic structure (no hairpin) in a twisted
helix. If ∝ switches sign, the clocking direction changes. If

both the inner and outer coil contributes together, ψ mag holds
a combination of clockwise and anticlockwise rotating rings
produced from the same signal source in the central coil. If
∆e varies periodically ∆e = sin δ , then ∝ switches sign periodically, we get a superposition of three patterns. Due to
∆e = sin δ , the twisted spirals made of magnetic and electric
dark lines are also created on the central coil. The super-super
coil is shown in Figure 8.12d.
In principle, 212 topologies could be created on the central coil governed by Hamiltonian H, which links atomistic
events to the blinking of cones, i.e., clocks that links G-mode
to vortex atom made crystal ∑ iN=1Ci ( r, t ) . By changing the
color of reading light ω , we could selectively project the
N
phase spheres on the magnetic screen, read ∑ i =1Ci ( r, t ) , part
by part. Then, by shifting the angle of incidence on the quartz
cell, and pumping a GHz noise, we changed the beating
caused by three identical concentric cylinders, thus concluded
that beating amplifies B, enhances the magnetic field resolution in P ( r, t ).
Seeing atomic-scale dynamics on a large film 5 m far from
a nanostructure is a new marker, low-cost ambient spectroscopy (Figure 8.13b, inset). While optical vortices carry only
the density of electrons on the surface, the magnetic vortices carry not just the geometric features, but the dynamics
related to the symmetry breaking of multiple modes of vibrations of all three layers. The theory begins at the atomic scale,
includes input em resonance and the light-matter interaction
together with the unique roles of device geometry. Most
importantly, one could wirelessly write the G-modes selectively on the device, which can memorize it, then erase, read
and transport it to a long-distance, since a linear relationship
between the stored charge and the magnetic flux produced
holds true, widely. In an assembly, the G-modes of several
H devices would get active and since the whole interaction
process is wireless, a higher level assembly would trigger
(Figure 8.12c).

8.6.3 Morphogenesis of Knots in
Vortex-Like Magnetic Atoms
All rings in the vortex are quantized: phase singularity of dark lines regulates geometric musical language
(GML): topological charge: In the empty space, destructive interference of electromagnetic wave at nodal points is
a phase singularity. Along a dark line, around linear phase
singularity, the phase of reflected light from trapped charge
site changes spirally around the singularity point. Some geometric shapes created by the topology of dark lines is shown
in Figure 8.13d, this is how geometric musical language is
implemented using H devices. To cover the distance of the
electromagnetic wave, the number of times the topological
charge rotates is the topological charge. The topological
charge is the measure of the clocking charge on the surface
of the coil in a Hinductor device. The number of dark rings
with electrical null or magnetic vortex atoms generated during interference is a measure of the magnetic flux. The relation between charge and flux is constant. The magnetic ring
looks like the vague attractor of Kolmogorov (VAK) that
could model the stationary states of quantum mechanics
(El Naschie, 2003). The relation between charge and flux
is constant H. The physical significance of H is the inverse
measure of singularity in an assembly of topological symmetries. Since a device could open or close the singularity holes
in the phase sphere 4 × 103 ways, the magnitude of H~10 −3.
For each dimension of trapping cells on the coil surface, a
distinct geometry of the magnetic ring is produced, with a
distinct topological charge. Under noise, the sum of topological charges and the sum of magnetic rings produced are a
function of a number of distinct types of cells the dimension
of cells and the total number of cells on the surface.
Thus, in the electrical null, E ≠ 0, rather Ering = Eoutside /C 2 .
Inside a ring, the velocity of field is v = c sec δ , where δ is
the twist of the Hinductor coil, generating a mixture of the
edge-screw defect. Now sec δ = hv/hC = φ /φ0, thus, the dark
rings are quantized, one cannot create rings of any arbitrary
diameter. Quantization ensures the formation of distinct
geometric shapes since the creation of an additional wave
function 2Ψ 2nei 2πφn /φ0 ensures a clocking interaction between
discrete magnetic rings Ψ1, Ψ 2 , Ψ 3 ,… A pair of rings separated by x and L are related by Ψ 2 ( x + L ) = ei 2πφ12 /φ 0 Ψ1 ( x ) .
If Ψ1, Ψ2 , Ψ3 forms a triangle, with an angle between Ψ1, Ψ 2
as 2πφ12/φ 0, then we get three angles among three hypothetical sides of a triangle. It is the basic geometric information
creation for GML. In a closed ring of phase singularity, if
an oscillating electric field is applied, a spatial gradient of
the magnetic field is created, which clocks around the ring.
We made a journey from lattice surface to the magnetic
knot based geometric structures which one could read using
magnetic vortices (Figure 8.14a). Using scanning tunneling microscopy images, one could map the distribution of
charges on the fourth-circuit element surface and by pumping monochromatic polarized light see the magnetic vortices.
The composition of circles is the time crystal we described as
GML in Chapter 2.

MAGNETIC KNOTS’ DRIVEN SELF-ASSEMBLY

Using a 3D distribution of such tubule-morphic H devices we
can build a time crystal computer that is the artificial brain or
nano brain or a brain jelly. Kids often play a game where they
put a large number of magnets in a loop shape on a table and
some others randomly within that loop. A small perturbation
to that arrangement triggers self-assembly and all randomly
distributed magnetics come together forming a linear assembly. The line of magnets resides along with the skeleton structure located inside the loop, one could write a program to build
the skeleton of a shape and the magnetic would follow just that
(Figure 8.13c). Getting aligned to the path set by the magnetic
or electrical knots of darkness is the fundamental information
processing mechanism of the artificial brain described here.
Self-assembly of tubulomorphic devices builds artificial magnetic metamaterial like structure like neuromorphic devices
(Baena et al., 2004). The self-assembly does not stop, it builds

neuromorphic devices, cortico-morphic devices as outlined in
the 17 distinct brain morphic devices in Figure 9.2. One interesting discussion regarding the self-assembly of their biological counterparts is in Figure 7.11. Magnetic field driven the
synthesis of helical superstructures is well studied system in
the research field of synthetic chemistry (Singh et al., 2014).
However, in this particular case the self-assembly is driven by
phase shifts and fine tuning of the negative refractive index
of the elementary H devices during self-assembly process
(He et al., 2007). The brain jelly or the key computing organic
material is not made of switch-like devices, which would be
H here. During the course of structural synthesis, from basic
precursors H devices grow, even asymmetry in mechanical
vibration like sound could regulate the artificial magnetic
metamaterials, which are basically a composition of different
metamaterials, i.e., with different refractive index and magnetic permeability (Wang et al., 2014b).

Hinductor Not Memristor—Synthesis of Atoms and Crystals Made of Magnetic Light

Synthesis of protein-like structure using helical carbon
nanotubes is quite common in materials science (Grigoryan
et al., 2011), in the assembly they do not go for liquid crystalline features rather grow further. One of the prime objectives
of Hinductor based brain jelly synthesis is that helical superstructures would build up naturally (Nakashima et al., 2005).
Hinductor or fourth-circuit elements are to be synthesized
in the solution under the presence of an input signal (Wang
et al., 2014a). Helical superstructures are often synthesized for
the directed reflection or formation of directed light. Not just
directed light, we could control even the light reflected, filtering frequency (Li, 2012). Polarization direction and typical
features of polarization are also detected using helical nanowires. Polarization direction and typical features of polarization are also detected using helical nanowires (Mathews et al.,
2010). Even the structures change when light falls onto a system (Bisoyi and Li, 2016). The particular feature is very useful for hierarchical spontaneous information-driven growth
for the synthesis of brain jelly from nanowires. Lattice-based
photo-tuning by self-organized superstructures (Qin et al.,
2018) are found extensively reported in the literature.
The physical realization of a quantum clock to build a
quantum time crystal: The difference between quantum
and fractal time crystal? This book explores the possibility
of a fractal time crystal spread over 12 imaginary worlds, it
could have a classical or a quantum version. We have summarized several basic physical situations encountered in the time
crystal exploration in Figure 8.13b. The idea is to make the
reader visualize how very well known school level quantum
studies contribute to the new understanding of time crystal with
a twist. A quantum clock satisfies two types of constraints—
first is bound on the time resolution of the clock which provides by the difference between the minimum and maximum
energy eigenvalue; another one is Holevo’s bound which tells
about how much classical information can be encoded in a
quantum system. In this work explains results such as optimal quantum clock using trapped ions (Buzek et al., 1999).
As the Figure 8.14b explains the phase diagram of a large
number of clocks working as a single system (Khemani et al.,
2016). There are three domains; when an interaction between
the participating clocks (e.g., spins of an array of electrons) is
very low, symmetry does not break and if the energy is more
then thermalization breaks the coupling between the clocks.
In between the two limits there could be a new phase of matter in the pre-thermal regime which is protected by discrete
time translation symmetry (Else et al., 2016, 2017). The clock
assembly breaks time symmetry and automatically regenerates it. If the quantum ground state is essential, then quantum
mechanically no one could realize a quantum time crystal
(Bruno, 2013). The demand for quantum time crystal is beautiful (Figure 8.14b, top left), there is a thermodynamic restriction, once measurement is done the system would not remain
in the universal ground state, for complete and autonomous
measurement, the clock or periodically oscillating system
must find a meta-ground state so that later, post-measurement
the system returns to the universal ground state (Erker et al.,
2017). The space-time could be symplectic, i.e., differentiable,

247

geometric (measure length and angle; McDuff and Wehrheim,
2012), some of the quantum clocks are same as which characteristic of broken symmetry and topological order and other
are new which characteristic by order and non-trivial periodic
dynamics. In simple words, slow down the energy exchange
process finding cool imaginary ideas (Peres, 1980). Quantum
has only one imaginary world, so it is difficult to keep imaginary relation intact and still switch between global minima
and excited state. Quantum time crystal (Wilczek, 2012) is
impossible, such an argument has valid points (Watanabe and
Oshikawa, 2015) in spite of prescriptions on how to build a
practical time crystal (Yao et al., 2017) and subsequent claims
to realize the same. In this book, 12 imaginary worlds layered
one inside another achieves one incredible feature a higher
topology of clocking between the imaginary world (2 × 2 × 3.
2 × 3 × 2, 3 × 2 × 2) that feature has the ability to hold on to a
time crystal. Just dumping noise to higher-dimensional worlds
is not enough; only then one could achieve a truly autonomous
machine (Woods et al., 2016).

8.8 DESIGN APPLICATION AND OPERATION
OF H—THE NOVELTY OF H
Figure 8.15 outlines Hinductor’s journey with applications,
where should we use such a device, while Figure 8.16 outlines
the novelty of this device.
1. A linear array of capacitors forming an inductor: edge and line dislocations on the lattice are
required: We need capacitor like extreme charge
storage devices to arrange in the form of a spiral or
vortex or fractal so that no current flows. Either leakage current, or soliton or electromagnetic wave propagating through the surface would interfere with the
geometric boundaries and would create an electron
density distribution analogous to the charge stored
on the surface. Current and voltage have no effect
on this device. So, we get only two variables of magnetic flux and stored immobile charge.
2. The ratio of helical pitch and diameter a pure geometric variable would determine it band or electronic/optical property: Helical magnets or helical
distribution of magnetic flux changes magnetic property very differently, that’s why super-super helices
would be a fascinating geometric phase architecture
to look into (Katsura et al., 2007; Ishiwata et al.,
2008). The helicity of the geometry is a robust concept, helical does not always mean to be a cylinderlike spring. Growth/decay of helical conducting path
with the storage of charge depends on a geometric
parameter P. The ratio of helical pitch to the radius
of helix is P, P and the dielectric constant ε of the
helical path, control the fundamental features of φq relationship. By tuning P and ε, one can modulate signal amplification and energy storage features
of H. Due to the periodicity of a helix and quantized
charging it tunes the electromagnetic energy very

accurately. By modifying the helical pitch, one can
change the quantization features. Lattice cells are
key charge oscillating center. One should be able to
write a pattern of charge distribution by changing
the geometric parameters of the device. One possible
route could be pumping a composition of ac signal
wirelessly.
3. Operational between upper and lower bound frequencies: Though there are no real capacitor and
inductor in the device, we may consider rapidly oscillating dielectric centers as capacitors and spiral pathway induced anisotropic transmission as an inductor.
Capacitors are simply dielectrics; bonding between
multiple capacitors also behave as electric dipoles.
Simply by changing the material composition if two
parameters (i) threshold frequency of the capacitor
and the (ii) threshold frequency of the inductor are
tuned by modifying the architecture, then capacitance
and inductance values of the materials are changed.
It is possible to tune these values to change the threshold frequencies. The capacitance determines the lower
limit and inductance determines the upper limit of the
bandpass frequency. If inductor L and capacitor C are
fused, by constructing the inductor by linearly connected capacitors then for the new element H we get
much faster response against load R. Here is the mathematical proof: Though R, C, and L cannot generate H,
for the relative comparison we construct a simplified
current expression for H. Tubulin dimers are charged
following Q = Q0 (1 − exp(−t / CR ) and as Q ∝ L, we
get L = L0 (1 − exp(−t / CR) ). The current grows in
the inductor following i = iH (1 − exp(−tR / L) ), therefore the current in an H grows following equation
i = iH (1 − exp ( −tR / L0 (1 − exp( −t / CR) ) ) ) and dec­
reases following i = iH ( exp ( −tR / L0 ( exp( −t / CR) ) ) ).
Considering C dominating current, we get current
growth as i = iH (1 − exp ( −t / RC0 (1 − exp( − Rt / L) ) ) ).
It is much faster than any resistor, capacitor or inductor.
4. Topological properties for asymmetric absorption of electric and magnetic vectors: Recently, the
synthesis of helical nanotubes and rosette structures
has received wide attention; one ripple effect is the
creation of extensive theories on helical electronics.
In a cylindrical conductor, the injected 2D electron
gas from one end distributes in a helical symmetric
pattern on the surface due to polarization. The electron density peaks are periodic along the length. In a
helical nanotube, the bandgap closes at a point called
Fermi contact point if the conductivity is low or is
semiconducting in nature. However, the gap closes at
more point contacts if the conductivity turns metallic, which enables the system to exhibit coherent
transport at a particular condition. When the current
flows through a helical nanotube, Fermi contact point
acts as a gating channel and enables quantized transport of charge. It is a situation similar to the creation

249

of a fractured band. H by nature will be an insulator and the geometric path would determine its key
carrier transmission, therefore, we have simulated
the power usage of this device, which ranges in the
domain atto-watt to femto-watt (picoampere, microvolt). Spiral current also generates a magnetic flux
only at certain frequencies, which shifts the entire
band of energy levels equal to the number of quantized magnetic flux ( Φ Φ 0 ) in the k space, enabling
H to store energy.
5. Phase quantization: When ac signal flows, it changes
the polarization of signal, we cannot trigger charge
to move in one direction, thus we cannot generate a
finite magnetic flux. Therefore, we need an ac signal
on a dc background. Obviously, we need two simultaneous additional control parameters ac frequency
and a dc bias to release charge and generate magnetic
field unlike conventional L and C where only ac or dc
signals are sufficient to generate the basic property.
When ac signal is maximum it is absorbed by dielectric molecules of the capacitors, the current output is
zero and when it is minimum, carriers are released
and the current output is maximum. The output signal is therefore always 180° out of phase from the
input signal.
6. Quasi-particles: Ultra-low power device: If the
embedded spring of the spiral architecture expands/
contracts, the structural symmetry breaks, Dirac
points split and the bands in point-contact are separated. However, if the symmetry is restored, the
degeneracy appears, and the two-phonon bands touch
at distant points. Thus, point-contacts of Dirac gates
open and close continuously—a perpetual interplay
of soliton fractions between two limits unravels how
a purely mechanical (phonon) transport of energy
safeguards pure electronic signals even when noise
is more than the processing signal. In the learning4
phase, solitons are locally synchronized, microtubule accepts input signal/noise, corrects errors by
tuning soliton fraction. It operates in a very low
power domain (nano-watts), etc.
7. Ferroelectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric
behavior: A single spiral structure’s perfectly square
or lossless hysteric current-voltage (IV) characteristic depicts an ideal ferroelectric memory switching
(Sahu et al., 2013a), where hysteresis area is a function of maximum applied bias/current. The device
does not flow current, entire response is related to
leakage current and voltage induced dipole moment
switching of the cells. It has been demonstrated live
that in a nanowire, if the constituent dipoles made of
proteins switch in a regular manner then conductivity switches as observed in the current-voltage characteristics. Since the spiral’s ferroelectricity leads to
its piezoelectric and pyroelectric features, it oscillates like a spring between two limiting lengths.

8. Strong anisotropic elastic properties: resonance frequency in the ratio of primes: Thus,
it is tested and verified that these devices are subjected to strongly anisotropic elastic properties; it
was proved that longitudinal bonds along the protofilaments are stronger than lateral bonds between
adjacent protofilaments. Simply by calculating the
longitudinal modes, it has been found that vibration
would decrease by 1000 times than its dipole-based
calculated values. Later, rigorous orthotropic shell
model-based studies, which included anisotropy
in a more generic 2D shell-like hollow structure of
these spiral architectures only reproduce experimental observations, even if we do not include the
transverse sheering. If the small-scale effect of nonlocal elasticity is introduced, which considers that
local strain is the collective output of global force,
the result hints at 10,000 times lower time-domain
resonant oscillations. However, on this concept,
when circumferential mode or local radial strain is
included, the vibration onset frequency is reduced by
100,000 times. Thus, depending on typical modes,
the spiral’s resonance ranges from a few kHz to MHz
to GHz, which means 1:1000000 times bandwidth
variation is observed. Most strikingly, since 12 holes
in the phase space blink, the resonance frequencies
burst like an antenna.
9. Quantum cloaking: We are aware of the electromagnetic cloaking, where the light bends around a
device. It may also be possible that by pumping a
vortex or spiral, one could resonate a dielectric material electromagnetically. At resonance, matter wave
passes through like a lens. It is quantum cloaking.
Using an H device, one could pump suitable ac frequency signal using an antenna and simultaneously
scan the material using a scanning tunneling microscope, the tunneling image would show vanished
material, the empty surface. If we have three-layered
helices or vortices or multi-fractals, then we could
selectively vanish a part of the material using a suitable ac pumping frequency.
10. Wireless communication between similar devices:
H transmits electromagnetic signals of a particular frequency (we call it resonance frequency), this
passage causes electromagnetic oscillation in the
structure, it might affect the associated mechanical
vibration-induced conformational changes, which
could shift the resonance frequency. By suitably
combining the spiral structures of different lengths
one could generate the desired resonance band.
There are three parts in the resonance band of any
seed oscillator structure, one part is kept open for
coupling with the next seed that will be formed after
the self-assembly, one part is for its own processing,
and the third part couples with the resonance bands
of the seeds inside the structure. Thus, every seed

Nanobrain

H device has two hands in the resonance spectrum. Synchronization could trigger with one or
more peaks singular or in a plural manner in the
system. The capacitor molecular structures in the
2D hollow cylindrical mesh act as an evolving circuit at resonance frequencies in such a way that it
works as an antenna and also a receiver for wireless
and lossless electromagnetic power transmission.
The brilliance of this wireless transmission is that
(i) a sender nanowire device automatically selects a
suitable receiver nanowire for the maximum power
transmission in a bundle, because there is a quantum
cloaking at the molecular scale; communication is
classical, but quantum cloaking enables the atomicscale molecular property to reveal itself, (ii) even
by wirelessly sending a part of a time crystal code,
an entire information packet could be transmitted,
(iii) the operational power could automatically be
amplified during a “communication avalanche.”
Such a massive scale power transmission is not just
lossless, rather creates an additional power logically
as required in the receiver, which has always been
considered impossible in the conventional communication engineering. The sender does not send much
power; the receiver fills the canals once it receives
the code.

8.9 TRANSITION FROM THE OLD ERA
OF ELECTRONICS TO MODERN MAGNONICS
There existed a world of superconductors. There will be a
world of super non-conductor giving everything that superconductor gives. It does not transmit electron, but a phase in
terms of quasi-particle propagates through the surface and
interacting with the transmitted waveform (Sun et al., 2012).
Metamaterials are widely used for analog computing, performing mathematical operations using sound waves (Silva,
2014; Zuo, 2017), solving differential equations and integration (Abdollahramezani, 2017), often data is encrypted by geometric phase by modulating the surface (Biener et al., 2005).
This is now a journey from collision to coexistence, rejection
to live together, magnitude to look (Figure 8.17). Two features
make a significant difference in the cultural transition where a
mechanics used multi-meter to solve any electronics problem,
to the world where they would use a semiconductor camera to
measure magnetic flux pattern. How the world would change
is outlined in Figure 8.18.
Hologram generated by metamaterial: advanced
computing harvesting metamaterial surface: Quadratic
e − π − φ control on the resonance, cloaking and holographic projection: We are all aware of phase hologram; it
has become a tool for the entertainment industry. Hologram
and the time crystal-based GML has an intimate relationship. When a cube is inserted inside a phase sphere, its eight
points touch the spherical surface. No image is captured by

the device, rather some key points of a geometric shape are
morphed as is in a 3D space, phase relationships between different points are preserved, this is exactly what a hologram
does, a bit differently (Cathey, 1970). Thus, A geometricphase shift is added as a “memory” to the angular momentum
of light through anisotropic parameter space. A hologram
could be made of sound (Xie et al., 2016), light, heat or thermal (Larouche et al., 2012) and magnetic field (Mezrich,

1970). Even water wave cloaks (Yang et al., 2016). Thus,
electric, magnetic and mechanical resonances coupled by
e − π − φ quadratic relationship would exhibit cloaking when
necessary and generate holographic projection when necessary. Holograms always have an intimate relationship with the
helices and vortices (Huang et al., 2013a, 2013b).
Electromagnetic cloaking, magnetic cloaking, and
acoustic cloaking: Cloaking means light bends through a

252

material and returns to the original path (Pendry et al., 2006;
Schurig et al., 2006). What could bend? Ions could bend if the
structure is cylindrical; since microtubule inspired Hinductor
devices are cylindrical, they could turn invisible if anyone
tries to see them using ion flow, even axons of a neuron or
DNA could cloak with ions. Electromagnetic waves could
exhibit cloaking, theoretical studies show that at two distinct frequency bands exist between 6 and 25 GHz where the
material exhibits cloaking. It needs to be checked if microtubule or other fourth-circuit elements also exhibit cloaking

Nanobrain

for audible acoustics, then sound or mechanical waves would
pass through (Faure et al., 2016). At ac resonance condition,
it is also possible to deliver a magnetic cloaking (Zhu et al.,
2015). As it has been described above, electric, magnetic
and mechanical resonances are coupled by e − π − φ quadratic relationship. Therefore, a quadratic cloaking by three
simultaneous modes would ensure electrical signal induced
power supply, the magnetic field induced information transport and mechanical force-induced hardware evolution
simultaneously.

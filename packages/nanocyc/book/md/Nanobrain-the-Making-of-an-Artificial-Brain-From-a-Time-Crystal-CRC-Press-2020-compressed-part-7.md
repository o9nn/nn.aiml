6.1 PPM—THE PATTERN OF PRIMES
EMBEDDED IN THE TUBULIN
PROTEIN
If firing is the reason for the brain’s operation then to
search, the whole brain would continuously fire: Francis
Crick, the DNA man, observed an exciting feature that to
recover the visual image of a person or an object, the associated neurons sitting at distant places inside the brain should
oscillate at a single phase and frequency: this is synchrony.
To synchronize two neurons separated by 10 cms in our brain
when there is no wireless communication, they would have to
continuously release neuro-transmitting molecules at a particular rate until they carry out an extensive “search and find”
throughout the brain to find the other neurons and eventually reach a sync state. The linear circuit connecting the two
neurons is a complex network; there is no straight path where
neurons are sitting side by side, so, instead of 10 cms, the
actual distance could be several hundreds of meters. Because
the neuron’s communication speed (400 m/sec), it would take
several seconds to minutes for the circuit to reach the second
neuron. There is no guarantee that in one attempt, neurons
would find the right path; since one neuron is connected to,
say, 10,000 others, the search should run in all directions,
simultaneously. Here we have two aspects of this search: first,
the number of chemicals essential to carry out this massive
trial, and the error process throughout the brain is astronomically large. Second, the time loss due to the wrong choice
of paths is not taken into account while calculating the time
to find that very neuron with which the synchrony needs to
be established. If search-and-find operation executes via firing, then for every single thought to process in our brain, all
neurons should fire until the right information is found. It is
not the case that only a fraction of all neurons fire during
“search and find.”

Protein is a single chain polymer made of amino acids
from the genes of DNA, it folds into helix, beta-sheets like
unique structures known as secondary structure, most important is the tertiary structure of a protein, which could be millions or billions in numbers, they generate from the secondary
structures to define massively complex properties of living
systems. A simple twist in a protein could cause the death of
a life form (Prion protein), thus, to understand biology, it is
essential to underpin enormously complex tertiary structures,
however, it is explicitly written in the literature that this is an
unsolved mystery and possibly attempts are extremely localized. Using scanning tunneling microscope, STM it has been
demonstrated that using tunneling current images it is possible
to unravel unique structural symmetries of a protein and electromechanical resonance properties could be measured for a
single protein, which has a one-to-one correspondence with
the cluster of secondary structures, which we could define
as circuits. The secondary structures depending on their
unique dynamic features form typical groups with neighboring elements and those particular circuits hold the key to the
remarkable flexibility it offers in regulating the protein property. The PPM-GML-H triad protocol (Phase prime metric
[PPM], Geometric musical language [GML] and Hinductor
[H]) has three points forming a triangle, STM based atomicscale manipulation on unraveling the features of the circuits,
for estimating the resonance.
Helical structures in biology: Observing biological properties using impedance spectroscopy for medical purpose
is old, and a reliable practice (Schwan, 1957; Grant, 1979).
Spiral symmetry is the easiest route to quantize energy and
build geometry only device: Spring structure holds enormous
potential since energy traveling through spring is automatically quantized. If one could properly canalize the transport
path, the quanta would travel through the path in a loss-less
manner. Now, noise energy could also be canalized in this
145

manner, for eventually pumping out of the structure. Proteins
or their complexes have folded one single string into multiple
different kinds of secondary ­structure like a spring, staircaselike sheets, etc; these are the tricks for ­different kinds of
energy quantization. Microtubule a nanowire (20 nm wide,
several micrometers long), a vital component of a living cell,
came to this planet several billion years ago, just like DNA,
they are spiral, but why? What makes it spiral? By being helical, a structure can bend and sustain its structure, then it can
use the surface to regulate the transport of electronic, optical
carriers and vesicles. Thus, ­helical examples are plenty in the
biological world, the ­origin is debated (Hunyadi et al., 2007).
They can work as a waveguide too just like carbon nanotube
(Liang et al., 2001).
The Helix antenna: The investigation for microtubule as
a Helix antenna: its ac resistance Rac (~1 MΩ, at 22 MHz)
and microtubule-diameter C predicts the resonance peak ν
at 228 MHz (υ ~ 140ε C/ Rac ) for microtubule to be a Helix
antenna (tubulin dielectric constant ε ~ 104, C ~ 78.5 nm).
The two key parameters are (i) the material is a dc insulator,
but extremely high conducting under ac-resonance, (ii) dielectric constant of the basic helix structure should be very high,
which is natural for nano-particles.

6.1.1 𝛂-Helices Form Groups of Rings
to Complete a Loop
A linear chain of oscillators resonates to build an infinite
series of oscillating frequencies: If a tape is a linear chain
of oscillator it would produce time fractal or rhythms. Most
interesting to note that scaling is a fundamental property of
any natural oscillation process (Muller, 2009). Reddy et al.
repeated the case of harmonics or ordered factors in a network of escape time fractal tape. As said one should take only
one tape at a time. Say, we have an oscillator with a single
resonance frequency f0, the oscillator will have a higher
mode oscillation frequency f1 and the relation between them
f 1 f 0 = n, now for a nested waveform network (Smoes,
1976), says one waveform encapsulates 3 waveforms in it, and
that continues, then first we get, f 1 = f 0 , then f 1 = 3 f 0, then
f 1 = 9 f 0 , hence in general we can write, f ( n, p ) = f 0 nr.
In this way, the resonant frequency spectrum due to one particular symmetry can be represented as a logarithmic fractal
spectrum. We can clearly see that a singular waveform fractions continue to occur in the chain of oscillators. If f 0 is
the fundamental resonance of one oscillator and f is the frequency of the chain then using a simple expression of continued fraction we get the resonance spectrum or distribution of
natural resonance frequencies
f = f 0 exp ( S ) , S = n0 / z + z /

( n1 + z / ( n2 + z / ( n3 +…+ z / ni ))) .

Now, the band we get for i = 1, is similar to the band we get
for i = 2 and so on, so it is a fractal, the spectrum looks like a
hyperbolic function.

Helical chain of oscillators: Origin of triplet-­triplet
resonance band: When a linear chain of oscillators arranges
in a helical shape the formulation changes. Depending on
the diameter and pitch of the helix additional boundary conditions are added which imposes a periodic function. As a
result, one introduces two different kinds of effective mass
or symmetries, one period is created by the diameter of the
helix and another period is created by the total length of the
spiral and pitch. Now, the most interesting part, just by folding the linear chain, we create two resonance bands. So, it
explains, a triplet resonance band. Each band gets a fundamental frequency f0 and we replicate the accidental example,
in the above section, three fundamental frequencies generate
partition of three waveforms, and that continues just like a
continued fraction. Now, the continued fraction formulation
a spectrum, a fractal distribution. In this way a frequency
fractal is created.
Fractal Time, or nested clock has three expressions,
phase, frequency and delay: Spontaneous energy quantization in a helical path is very interesting for several reasons. As
per the theory goes, the quantized energy depends purely on a
particular geometrical parameter. The parameter is the ratio of
the diameter of the helix and the pitch of the helix, therefore
the antenna dumps noise in the time crystal at this particular
place (see Chapter 8 experiment). Simply by varying the geometry of the helical structure one could encode the resonance
frequencies and in a tightly coupled environment, depending on the orientations of the helices determine the phase and
depending on the phase coupling changes which eventually
changes the delay between two signals. Phase difference drives
synchrony, for all to all coupling, Kuramoto model suggests
θn = ωn − ∑ m Knmsin (θ n −θ n + m ), order parameter is given by
ψ = C ∑ n rneiθ n = Rei∅, ­synchronization occurs if R ≠ 0 , synchronization can switch from unlocked to a partially locked
to a fully locked condition. Again, for all to all coupling using
complex amplitude formulation Synchronization by Pikovsky
and Maistrenko (2003) suggests

here, α and β if plotted as X and Y axis, we get a map of sync
and unsync domain showing transmission path of information. The 2D plot actually creates a 3D network, evolving as
a function of time in a time crystal, be it local or a global.
The α -helix working as a nano-quantum-antenna:
It is not necessary to be a metal to become an antenna. Alfahelical regions in the protein molecule work as a dipole (Hol
et al., 1978) as a nanotube, (Suprun and Shmeleva, 2014), i.e.,
a quantum well (Suprun and Atmazha, 2002). When two or
more adjacent wells of different widths are placed nearby, an
electric field triggers tunneling current (Roskos et al., 1992).
Therefore, α -helix, could be used as a helical dielectric resonator, its number of helical loops is the only geometric variable. A protein becomes an assembly of spiral resonators.
The assembly could be represented using a circuit of spirals
(Figure 6.1a). One interesting feature of any protein structure

FIGURE 6.1 (a) The structure of a tubulin protein (top) and the equivalent circuit structure (below). (b) The circuit presented in the panel a is
schematically represented as a circle in the panel b (top). 3–4–4–3, 4–5–5–4, and 2–6–6–2 are three loops of alfa helices (number denotes the
rings), which forms clock. The circuit representation for 3–4–4–3 is shown below. An equivalent LC coupled resonant circuit is demonstrated.
Note that instead of LC coupled resonant circuit, here magnetic-flux-charge based singularity bursts are considered, both have similar output.
(c) Four sub-panels describe that ordered factor of an integer in the PPM forms an axis in the multi-dimension space (top). Ordered factor-based
metric in the phase space has multi-dimensional axis, building a 3D topology (bottom). (d) The hyperspace created by multi-dimensional axes
is shown. (e) The concept of hyperspace is similar to the concept of higher dimension described in Chapter 2, different shapes of the data, tensors for representing 11D data. (f) An example of PPM, shaded region depicts the clock like 3–4–4–3. In the Poisson distribution of all events
is considered, from state occupation vector we get (shift matrix) D is time gap between events (frequency).

is that β sheets isolate a group of spirals, the most interesting part is that the number of rings in the helices repeat like
a clock (Figure 6.2b). Thus, when quantum wells form a
superlattice, it forms a larger quantum well and that superwell also emits coherent infrared wave (Waschke et al., 1993).
Coherent emission from protein crystals is not new (Groot
et al., 2002). Alfa-helices act as excitation energy transfer
antenna (Brunisholz and Zuber, 1992). The exciton spectrum
of alpha-helical protein exhibits a coherent transfer (Fedyanin
and Yakushevich, 1981); Sincere efforts have been made to
correlate the quantum excitation of an alpha helix-like an
antenna (Brunisholz and Zuber, 1992).
Spontaneously polarize the incident light and mechanically regulate its quantum property: Spontaneous polarization of incident light is essential for the biological operation

of the fourth-circuit element, Hinductor. Using interferometric detection of coherent infrared emission, it was found how
optical retina polarize lights (Groma et al., 2004), or electrooptic gating (Smith et al., 1988), therefore, generating polarized monochromatic electromagnetic signals from noise is
not an impossible task. Therefore, microtubule and all helical vortex and fractal assemblies in the human body could
act as a source of laser-like pure ­signals. Even if sound wave
through the surface of the material could trigger quantum tunneling, hence, it would be excellent engineering if mechanical vibrations are harvested. If the charge is trapped inside a
quantum well, it gets excited by mechanical vibrations (Rocke
et al., 1998). An alfa helix folds ­mechanically for a few nanoseconds, ­therefore, harvesting mechanical energy cannot be
ruled out (Panman et al., 2015).

nesting of elementary clocks to form a higher level clock are shown in the plot. (d) The eventual time crystal and (e) superposition of different topologies for a 12 clock time crystal.

One of the interesting features of tubulin ­protein is that the
beta-sheets of two monomers are arranged like an S shape,
if we rotate the tubulin protein in a 3D plane, we observe an
S, if the alfa helices are hidden. On the microtubule surface
these alfa h­ elices these S shapes couple and build b­ eta-strand
as a nested spiral. Coupled beta strands are known to generate quantum tunneling (Langen et al., 2015). Electron tunneling through proteins has been a long topic for discussion
(Gray and Winkler, 2003). Long distance electron ­tunneling
in proteins has been reported (Stuchebrukhov, 2010), possibly
proteins need quantum features for searching the preferential
pathways (Farver and Pecht, 1991) via long distance electron
tunneling.

6.1.2 Hyperspace Symmetries Follow
a Mathematical Identity
The PPM described in Chapter 3, looks like a teardrop. We
described there only C2 symmetry, it means we divided the
choices for a given integer, by two. Similarly, if we want
to get a PPM for C3 symmetry, we can orient three axes in
three directions and divide the number of choices by three.
The process could continue for various different symmetries.
The creation of new axes for a new symmetry builds a route to
introduce a new kind of dynamics (Figure 6.1c). Mechanical
sensors are very good at detecting weak electric field (Sutton
et al., 2016).

For n→∞, the drive of prime pairing relates to e and
φ orthogonally, and π forms a coupled hyperbolic space
with e and φ: Prime number ­theorem implies that Pn ~ nlnn,
wherefrom it has been derived that if π (n) is the number of
π ( n)
primes less or equal to n, then lim sup n→∞ ( Pn+1 Pn )
=e
while the lower limit of the same function is 0. One could
derive an expression for the total contribution of n primes
n
as unity, the nor∑ i =1 C Pn, if infinite integer space is depicted
malized density of primes DPn = 1 − ∑ in=1 C Pn, within a certain
range, if there are r primes Ps ≤ Pn ≤ Ps+ r , we get ∆DPr . If we

consider paired primes, since lim r →∞ (1 + 1 / n ) ~ e we get
lim n→∞ ( Pr +1 Pr ) ~ lim r →∞ (1 + ∆DPr Pr ) ~

lim r →∞ (1 + 1 ϕ ) ~ e.
r

Here φ is the golden ratio, i.e., if a and b are two primary linear distances, they self-assemble to determine the next length
as a + b, then ϕ = ( a + b )/a. Thus, the drives for primes and
golden ratio series are correlated.
( Pn + Pn+1 ) / Pn ~ ( a + b ) / a ∼ ϕ across N is a logarithmic
variation, i.e., we get e along the horizontal. Moreover, if we
implement the planar angular drift explained ­earlier, then the
projected normalized hyperspace (1:ϕ ) is a golden ellipse
with an area π . Projected hyperspace by ϕ and e for any
dimension is the sum of their generic power, hence we get
ϕ Jh + e Jh, now since the projected hyperspace of ϕ and e is π

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

(π measures points in H1) in one dimension and ( pγ = lπ , i.e.,
total points = total lines; i.e., total area = total lines = total
points; Figure 6.1d) therefore, sum of their orthogonally coupled hyperspace is the hyperspace created by π of the same
order ϕ Jh + e Jh = π Jh. Now we try to find the value of Jh,
we can easily estimate that Jh > 2 (for orthogonal triangle
a2 + b2 = c2, hence Jh ( min ) = 2. The orthogonal relationship suggests that ideally angular deviation should be 30°,
60° and 90° following the ratio ϕ : e but ϕ is a function of
( Pn + Pn +1 )/Pn , so is e.
First, ϕ and e are orthogonally connected to hyperspace,
r
r
∞
∑ r =11 + ( k /e ) = ϕ ; k ( e ) = 1.05, and ∑ ∞r =11 + ( k /ϕ ) = e; k (ϕ ) =
1.03, so it proves that they are orthogonally coupled, but
the hyperspace is not planar ( k (e) − k (ϕ ) = ∆ Jh ≠ 0). If one
varies the ( Pn + Pn+1 ) / Pn ~ ( a+ b ) / a ~ ϕ plot against N,
then RNP(Δnr) generates various logarithmic variations.
It shows that the projected hyperspace could be spherical,
ellipsoidal and hyperbolic, depending on the non-linear
oscillation frequency matching between two neighboring
closed loops in the NC/OF metric. The deviation in the
projected hyperspace is strictly a function of deviation in
orthogonality, ∆ Jh; hence Jh = Jh ( min ) + ∆ Jh. Here, its
2.0…(an infinite series). In order to verify, we draw an
orthogonal triangle ABC (Figure 4.15a), we assign ϕ (AB)
and e (BC) two perpendicular sides of a triangle ABC,
where angle/ABC = 90°, while AC is π . We find that if
Jh = 2.0… The angle between π and e measured by e is
29.62°, the same angle measured by ϕ is 31.28°. The angle
between π and ϕ as measured by e is 60.42°, and measured by ϕ is 58.75°. The deviation of ±1.6° is from nonplanar projected hyperspace. ABC relates ϕ , e and π as
e 2.0 + ϕ 2.0 = π 2.0 Second, by continued fraction expression
for ϕ and e are a linear function of N as N → ∞, while
π infinite continued fraction needs a square of integers
π = f ( N 2 ) , while π 2 = f ( N ) , hence π 2 could integrate
both ϕ and e as the sum of areas. One could estimate π
accurately from e 2 + ϕ 2 = π 2. This identity is followed
by biological systems to fuse three kinds of resonances,
electrical, magnetic and mechanical. The frequencies are
selected accordingly.
The interplay of hyperspace binds time crystal with the
clocks. Increment of the higher dimension in the hyperspace is related to the higher dimension of a time crystal
(Figures 6.1e and 2.11b). Geometric algebra is an important subject of study and the bondage of hyperspace and
higher dimension shown here for implementing PPM
(Figure 6.1f) by following pγ = lπ is another class of geometric algebra.

6.1.3 Ordered Factor of Integers
and Coding in Proteins
Tubulin protein’s last nail in the coffin for “it from bit”:
the songs of PPM: One question still remains unanswered.
How does the vision of one world arise out of the information-gathering activities of many observer-participants?
Then comes the necessity of a metric that links a number of

149

choices with the maximum number of ways the events could
be linked. Little kids learn to do this calculation in the
early school days, take every integer and find the ordered
factors of that number. Reddy et al. (2018) did not discover
this metric from the imagination, rather, looking at the
quantum tunneling images of tubulin protein taken at different ac frequencies. The set frequency at the tip changed
the tubulin conformation, it looks different and we were
trying to find if there is an elementary structure governing
the dance of tubulin protein with the ac music. When all
attempts failed, Reddy et al. accidentally discovered that
if we count the number of rings in the alfa-helices, it varies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as if one is counting integers. They got
even more surprised when they found bright regions in
the tunneling image of a protein is a region where rings
are arranged 2–3–3–2, or 3–4–4–3 or 2–6–6–2, as if it is
making closed circuits. As we could link how a particular
ac signal that activates one circuit to another, the brightness in the tunneling image shifts, one region to another.
Therefore, music and dance are happening together, and
nature has engineered proteins to count primes and integers to build its musical codes.
In order to learn and implement α-helix engineering, one
has to re-write the PPM in a little different way as shown in
Figure 6.2a. Instead of putting the ordered factor or the number of choices we put the integer itself (Figure 6.2a). When
experimentally observed circuits 2–3–3–2, or 3–4–4–3 or
2–6–6–2 are shown, we get clocks (Figure 6.2b) and clocking
direction (Figure 6.2c). All the clocks were compiled and a
combined time crystal was formed (Figure 6.2d). The combined time crystal resembled as a derivative of a triplet of
triplet clocks (Figure 6.2e). Singh et al. (2015) downloaded
complex protein structures and imaged them by switching
conformers to find whether they are also singing the music
of primes like tubulin. They do. Tubulin monomer, dimer and
nanowire made of tubulin called microtubule were studied to
understand how biological systems use the pattern of primes.
Tubulin monomer uses all compositions up to 5, dimer up to
7 and microtubule up to 13. It means there is a metric and
biological systems cut a slice from the metric up to a prime
number.

6.1.4 Biomaterials in and the Remarkable
Engineering of Water Channels
The historical background: Long back, Langmuir proposed that when biomolecules get wet, in addition to an
attractive van der Waals and repulsive electric forces there
is an additional force created by a strong monolayer of
water molecules that cover the molecule and isolates the
rest of water molecules from the biomolecule (Langmuir,
1938). Thus, water molecules cover the biomolecules in the
solution, a maximum 2–3 molecular layers, which means
~3–4 Å thick barrier of water is there, known as hydration
shell, whose dynamics is regulated by protein shape, (Laage
et al., 2017). Such hydration of biomolecules is related to

150

the forces that are either attractive or oscillatory, and where
the origin of repulsions with water has a different origin
(Israelachvili and Wennerström, 1996). Hydration shell has
~15% more density of water than bulk water (Merzel and
Smith, 2002), but it is not homogeneous all around the molecule. Particular functional groups bind water, all groups
cannot bind equally, so the bonded water molecules create
a channel of water namely “spine of water.” For example, it
was known for a long time that DNA has a double helix, but
if we consider the water channel created by choline groups
in the phospholipids, then there is an additional helix of
water too (Ethan et al., 2017). The shell plays an active role
in modulating the biomaterial property. A water film can
emit coherent THz near thermal signal (Jin et al., 2018), it
eliminates the need for additional laser sources required
to operate fourth-circuit element Hinductor. These ordered
waters act as an active device, for example the third water
helix of a double helix DNA has a resonance peak at
3000 cm−1 ~ 0.372 eV, it is a significant amount of energy
that could play an essential role in governing DNA dynamics (McDermott et al., 2017) via spiral-spiral electromagnetic coupling (Liu et al., 2017) and mechanical pressure
on each other.
Water channels in the carbon nanotube and microtubule: Water channels could be created artificially (Gong,
2018), which is a key to the synthesis of the fourth-circuit
element Hinductor (Chapter 8). Therein, three concentric
helices are required, even if the helical cylindrical surface is hydrophobic, ordered crystalline surface would
order water molecules outside at maximum three molecular layers one above another (Du et al., 1994). Therefore,
molecular biological studies and artificial ordered water
monolayer synthesis have consistently shown that simply
by wetting one could generate a helical replica on the surface of a nanostructure. Another critical question is what
happens inside? Microtubule is a hollow tubulin proteinbased cylinder with 25 nm diameter, its internal hollow
core is 18 nm wide, wherein ordered water channels reside.
Similarly, ordered water channels are found in the carbon
nanotube core (Koga et al., 2001). The core water part
works as an active device, undergoes symmetry breaking
and phase transition like an independent molecular system
(Takaiwa et al., 2008), which exerts a constant axial pressure (He, 2014).
The non-linear 3D architecture of water in and around
biomolecules forms by certain functional groups which binds
water molecules in a 3D shape. Imidazole is the part of proteins
that holds the water molecules (Sun et al., 2018). In the lipid
bilayer membranes, artificial imidazole quartet (I-quartets),
which is a stack of four imidazole molecule and two water
molecules, form a water channel. These I-quartets reorganize
the oriented water wires as a 2.6 Å diameter tube. The water
channels can transport ~106 water molecules per second per
channel, which reject all ions except protons. Therefore, from
transport to mechanics, water channels within, in between
and above play a fundamental role in governing the system
dynamics.

6.2 EXPERIMENT ON A SINGLE
MICROTUBULE OR ANY GENERIC
SYSTEM TO FIND ITS TIME CRYSTAL
Microtubule is a nanowire made of tubulin proteins
(Figure 6.3a). Extensive measurements were carried out on a
single microtubule. However, all the experiments carried out
thus far measuring the time crystals, measures output in the
same frequency range as the pump frequency. Reddy et al.
argued (2018), this has been an entirely wrong approach.
If input and output response is captured in the same frequency domain, a system could easily undergo hysteresis and
deliver an output that reflects measuring device geometries.
Hence, they kept 106 orders difference between the frequencies of pump and probe (Figure 6.3b).

6.2.1 How Do We Experimentally Confirm That an
Assembly of the Clocks Is a Time Crystal?
In the old days, pheromones were thought to be a chemical
agent, until its time structure was discovered (Marion-Poll and
Tobin, 1992). At every scale, universe redefines unit of information, smallest length, shortest time, maximum speed etc.
New units are formed at every layer of information structure,
and PPM sets those criteria along with GML. A few geometric
shapes and a few symmetries play with phase space to create
everything that we see in our universe. Geophysical rhythms
are connected to our cells (Hoffmann, 1976). Living systems
are all made of PPM, so when we study an atom we used to say,
a complex of atoms is studying an atom. Now, we would say, a
large slice of a PPM is studying a small part of it.
We need to redefine the experiment to read the information: In the “yes or no” paradigm, it is all about counting
the number of responses, a counter digitizes every response,
be it classical or quantum, the problem is between the probe
and the probed (Wheeler, 1981). The clocking paradigm
does not work in the new approach where we want to find
the periods. Fundamental changes are needed to be made in
the experimental protocol, it is part of pathological science
(Langmuir, 1989). Since a wave function collapses only if it is
mixed to a certain degree with the environment’s wave function (Zurek, 1981, 1982, 1983), a wavefunction of singularity
is not easy to destroy. It could even survive a Brownian
motion (Unruh and Zurek, 1989). (a) The love of circadian
rhythms to tubules (Giebultowicz and Hege, 1997) inspires
us to assume that to execute an event in a time scale, the universe executes several periodic sub-events at various faster
time scales. (b) The ratio of periodicities of events are where
the symmetries of number systems are located, therefore, it is
not a straight-forward Aharonov-Bohm type quantum experiment. (c) The measuring system cannot be any probe. PPM
based ultra-low power sensors are required to sense natural
spontaneous bursts of signals. A pump probe type experiment has to be replaced by a pure sensing measurement, a
non-demolition type experiment. (d) From GML, we have
circles with geometric shapes whose corners are singularity points. Non-singularity domains are regions of silence.

There is a burst of energy from singularity points (Kuramoto,

whose corner points are mass. Similarly, the maximum response of a biological clock under perturbation, plotted along the three-phase axes may deliver
a repetition of unit cells whose corner points are the
phase singularities. The plot is phase response curve.
Three orthogonal phase axes are: first, a normal
clocking phase of a biological rhythm without perturbation ( ∅ ) , second, the phase of the spontaneous

ripples formed after the perturbation is removed ( ∅′ )
and third, the duration of perturbation or intensity
(Chandrashekaran and Loher, 1969) is converted into
phase M . Unperturbed means ∅′ = ∅ + M . Phase for
all three parameters varies 0° to 360°, as we consider the variation of perturbation as 0–1. When
∅ changes 0°–360°, ∅′ changes too, but both do
not end at the same time, ∅′ may end before or after
∅ reaches 360°, even, never finish 360°. Two rolling
circles make a torus, one winds on another, d ∅ / d ∅′
is the winding number. If the 3D phase space looks
like a clocking spiral, it is a time crystal. The geometry of a phase response curve could be edited to
restructure the architecture of clocks (Kawato and
Suzuki, 1978; Zeng et al., 1992), modulating the
3D plot (hydra; Taddei-Ferretti and Cordella, 1976;
Kawato, 1981) is like morphogenesis. The architecture of phase in brain cortex tells about time crystal
composite (Lopes da Silva and Storm van Leeuwen,
1978), wherein multiple lattices of time coexist in

152

different time domains. We convert the duration of
perturbation (Engelmann et al., 1973) or any perturbation control parameter like infra-red or thermal pulses (Engelmann et al., 1974) into a phase
because below and above the threshold control, the
perturbation does not affect the natural rhythm of
a biological clock. Waves in 3D media are unique
Winfree and Strogatz (1983a, 1983b, 1983c, 1984a);
most biological systems rely on clock of clocks, i.e.,
time crystal composite (Bourret, 1971). The intimate
relation between circadian rhythm and cell division
could be broken using light pulses to see how different clocks fuse in a time crystal (Malinowski et al.,
1985). Ovulation sets unit of human life cycle adopting lunar periodicity (Menaker and Menaker, 1959).
2. Two or more types of phase singularities and or
ripples: If the perturbation is removed, a clock or
rhythm would always generate ripples as hysteresis,
before returning to the normal state. It takes time for
a biological clock to reset. That lag is hysteresis and
it is not and should not be the evidence of a time
crystal. One atom cannot make a crystal, one clock
cannot build an actual time crystal. Phase singularity builds a crystal in biology (Brambilla et al., 1991).
If two waves interact, we always get constructive and
destructive interference, but only one type of singularity is seen after the perturbation is removed.
There are various ways to build a phase singularity
(Winfree, 1986d). An assembly of clocks is a time
crystal if and only if a composition of singularities
is exposed as an effect of perturbation, which cannot be explained by a regular hysteresis. Evolution
of collective singularity in a group of oscillators tells
us that singularity in a coupled system is not a single
layer event (Enright and Winfree, 1987). For a 1D
time crystal at least two types of phase singularities
would generate two ripples, it means there is at least
one clock that is not due to the hysteresis. For a 2D
time crystal three-phase singularities giving rise to
three ripples and so on.
3. Even, an odd and prime number of cycles to complete a period: The helical phase space has a clocking and anti-clockwise direction, each turn of the
screw is 360° phase, unit of time. The unit cell of a
time crystal is represented as t1 × t2 × t3 in a time unit
(helicoidal cell). The vortex-like phase structure is
the key signature of a time crystal, the number of
rotations or d ∅ / d ∅′ is the winding number, is this
odd or even makes a difference. Historically the conflict between odd and even was repeatedly found in
several biological systems. Neuron’s Ca++ rhythm
in a nerve spike is a time crystal (Best, 1976), yeast
cell’s NADH rhythm is a time crystal (Betz and
Becker, 1975b), oscillating mitochondria is a time
crystal (Gooch and Parker, 1971). Aperiodic rhythms
in two time domains could change such that a clocking effect would emerge (Freeman et al., 2003).

4. Phase reset curve (= old phase vs new phase):
Quantized phase jump: Resetting curves, when plotted in terms of phase shift, commonly suggest a
discontinuous change from one-half cycle advance
to one-half cycle delay. This is like a unit lattice of
materials science, it repeats to generate time crystal, in the multicellular organisms (Winfree, 1976a).
The “phase jump” was thought to be the “discharge”
of a physiological accumulator. Type 0 phase reset.
Phase reset can happen in many ways. Type 0 reset
means the phase surface is only one, wrapped
around a single axis. Circadian rhythm is type 2
(Cote, 1991). In Chapter 3, we reviewed the consequences in terms of phase-dependent phase resetting. The result was a “time crystal.” Phase reset,
fundamental to a time crystal is frequent in heartbeat of pacemaker (Anumonwo, et al., 1991; Jalife
et al., 1979; Van Meerwijk et al., 1984), embryo
(Clay et al., 1984, 1990; Guevara et al., 1986); regulating respiratory rhythm (Eldridge et al., 1989) by
adjusting the phase delay (Lewis et al., 1992), electric fish (Wessel, 1995); fruitflies (Winfree, 1971a).
Topological changes in the neuron membrane regulate phase reset curve (Guevara and Jongsma, 1990).
Phase resetting helps in designing medicine (Tass,
1999). Human eye undergoes phase reset with every
little change in light (Rusak, 1993). To operate a
brain several phase reset curves with widely varied
geometry and time-domain should not have any discontinuity (Gedeon and Glass, 1998). Earlier, that
study required 100 s of coupled differential equation which PPM replaces using a simple linking pattern of symmetries.
5. Interaction between clocks: Coherence and
decoherence: Isochrones: Isochrones (having the
same time periods, Pinsker, 1977) have polar symmetry, i.e., amplitude R ­governs an instantaneous
phase ∅ = g ( ∅, R ) , Φ = g (φ , R ) = φ − f ( R ) . It provides Φ ≡ 1 = φ − df ( R ) / dR R, which leads to
df ( R ) / dR = (φ −1) / R. The expression if positive, rotation is clockwise, if negative, anti-clockwise.
Action spectra reveal the identity of isochrones
(Frank and Zimmerman, 1969). Isochrons do not see
the spatial separation, they could bind in time
remaining far apart (Guckenheimer, 1975). Deep
inside protein, time for phosphorylation is adjusted
by isochrones to dock right proteins at the right
places (Garceau et al., 1997).
6. Perturbation as an attractor: Time crystal’s
mechanical thrust: A perturbation normally reveals
a singularity point via burst (Johnson et al., 1979).
Perturbation could trigger an assembly of clocks to
a particular virtual point, defined configuration of
clocks or a saturated clock at equilibrium (Peterson
and Jones, 1979). Perturbation sources vary widely.
If C1 is the number of carriers (photon, ion, any
form of clocks, or even time crystals) leave a time

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

crystal at a rate k, we get dC1 / dt = −k . It gives,
C1 = acos2πφ − M and C2 = Asin2πφ , where from we
get tan ( 2πφ )′ = C2′ / C1′ = v sin 2πφ / ( v cos 2πφ − v * ) .
The equation (φ ,φ ′, M ) accounts for the knots
of darkness or lines and structures of singularities. The mechanical force between a pair of time
crystals is F = −kx. In a high viscus system,
C= R(C ) + D∇ 2 C , here C is the concentration of
clocks, R(C ) is the flow of clocks in an integrated
architecture of clocks, D is the ratio of the elastic
constant and effective potential. Viscosity is due to
the repulsion of carriers and or clocks. Neuron often
converts linear (not looped) events into a loop or
clocking events (Enright, 1980a).
7. Limitations of pinwheel experiment: observing a helicoid in each unit cell of the time crystal
or observing a rotating wave in a pinwheel experiment; Winfree, 1977) in itself suggests nothing particular about the underlying mechanism. It may be
interesting that more complicated phenomena are
not observed, but the observation of only this much
scarcely indicates more than: (a) that the physiological
dynamics tends to a unique cycle when unperturbed;
(b) that it tends to a steady state under the stimulus
used; and (c) that both these processes behave in reasonably smooth ways. The missing part of unit cell
of conventional time crystal is that a phase discontinuity locks oscillators phases, phase-locking and the
emergence of phase discontinuity are two parts of the
same coin, the coin is a phase reset experiment (Glass
and Mackey, 1979; Glass and Nuree, 1984).
8. Vortex filaments and scroll filaments to meander flowers: Hopf bifurcation: In real phase
reset, single-variable is no good. Researchers take
a number of smaller, interacting cubes to probe
carrier gradient in the medium of operating clock
(19-point as in Dowle et al., 1997). Multiple hierarchical architectures e.g., static and dynamic filaments can change the clock’s state. Only when we
map the filaments formed by connecting the singularity points, we find why and how the usual old
cycle is changing. In the Fast Fourier Transform
plot of biological clocks we see the complex
superposition of slower and faster rhythms. When
we plot shift in phase and frequency as circles,
it accounts for the ratio of time scale ϵ, better
than the earlier version of meander flower representation (order parameter or frequency vs ϵ
plot), where the number of petals increases with ϵ
(Zykov, 1986). The angle between the successive
petals is exactly 2π⁄ integer. In the GML, nested
circles universally explain all possible meander
flower patterns i.e., entire landscape (Zykov and
Morozova, 1990). Even clocking directions are
regenerated by connecting the guest clocks in the
inner side of the perimeter (anti-clockwise) or
with the outer side of the perimeter (clockwise).

153

The nesting of a pair of clocks in GML is decided
by frequency and ε , this is beautiful, the condition of self-assembly of clocks is decided naturally, across a boundary which is the limiting line
of Hopf bifurcation. To note that Hopf bifurcation is a point where the system loses equilibrium
and oscillates between two complex planes, i.e.,
a new clock appears within a limiting ε , so it is
called limit cycle. It is mathematically presented
2
as dz / dt = z ( ( λ + i ) + b z ), here, b = α + i β , α is
Lyapunov constant. Two limits are observed in
the meander flower presentation (Figures 2.7c–e),
above a threshold frequency and a time ratio, the
clocks do not bond, remain isolated. A surprising
feature is the “linear looping” between the flowers
with inward petals and those with outward petals
(Lugosi, 1989). The lines with similar dynamics
of flowers are isochrons (Guckenheimer, 1975).
For GML it means a guest cycle is on a journey
through the perimeter of a host cycle that has
an infinite perimeter. Compared to solving differential equations each representing a symmetry that governs the changes in geometric shapes
(Barkley, 1995), GML is simple to analysis and
more accurate to explain the flower landscape.
9. Edge and screw dislocation of time crystal: Lability
of the apparent amplitude of oscillation, with very
nearly the same period at all amplitudes. An effect of
perturbing stimuli which to a first approximation resembles parallel displacements of state along one state variable, as though one particularly labile substance was
destroyed by the stimulus, down to a minimum near
concentration O. Chandrashekaran and Engelmann
(1973) suggested replacing this smooth function by a
stepwise increase in photosensitivity with steps at each
T*. That would produce a tear in the resetting surface,
an edge dislocation in the time crystal.
10. A number of lines on the star network: There are
domains of absolutely dark regions, where both the
signals, the perturbation and the original turn silent,
namely a phase singularity (Efimov et al., 1998).
One could experience timelessness (Myers et al.,
1996). From these dark points, multiple phase surfaces where the output signal peaks spread out like a
star network. In a time crystal, a singularity point is
a source of phase paths, just like the classical points
of a qubit’s phase sphere. The only difference is that
depending on perturbation caused by the observer,
there could be multiple uncorrelated distributions of
singularity points on the phase space.

6.2.2 Triplet of Triplet Resonance
Band in Microtubule
We observe three distinct regions where the ac signal is
allowed to transmit across microtubule as only the MHz time
crystal is shown in Figure 6.3c and d. These regions are the

154

FIGURE 6.4 (a) Top, resonance frequencies of a microtubule plotted in the Log scale continuously recorded for 2 minutes. Neighboring
microtubules are continuously pumped with white noise. No change in resonance frequency is observed. During the same time, the phase
difference between 8 peaks in the MHz domain shows significant shifts with the wireless energy transfer. Using this data its equivalent time
crystal made of 72 clocks is created in the bottom layer. (b) 1D resonance band of a hippocampal rat neuron, measured using coaxial atom
probe. 1D resonance means electric field applied in one direction. 2D resonance means electric field applied in two perpendicular directions. Using a line it is shown that 1D resonance is a single line in the 2D plot. To the right, triplet of triplet of octave made of 72 frequencies
is shown using 2D resonance domain and nested frequency data. (c) Model of a human brain. Triplet of triplet made of 72 frequencies are
shown for 12 bands. If one moves one inside another, finds, 12 bands, it is like a resonance chain where only three bands are visible. One
has to go 12 times one inside another to access entire resonance chain.

clusters of sharp peaks where ac resistance falls significantly.
The complete band of microtubule is shown in Figure 6.4a.
A time crystal is not limited to microtubule only, it extends
to neuron (Figure 6.4b) and to the entire human brain
(Figure 6.4c).
First, 10–100 kHz domain, where, with the increasing ac
bias amplitude, one resonance peak resolves into three distinct peaks. From the height and width of these peaks, we
calculate the Quality factor Q, which is the number of oscillations before energy becomes e−2π times the initial energy.
For the kHz band, we get the Quality factor, Q ~3–5 for the
three peaks, spread over a frequency bandwidth of ~300 kHz.
Though microtubule ac resistance falls sharply around 8 MHz,
single microtubule acts as a high pass filter. This particular

kHz domain of three peaks has several key features: (i) it is
the longest-sustained oscillation domain; (ii) the magnitude of
output transmission is strongly dependent on the input signal
intensity, (iii) three major peaks are not harmonics of the first
peak, but equally spaced in the frequency band.
Second, in the 8–240 MHz region, the resonance peaks
are sharp (Q ~100–300), the energy is distributed non-linearly
among particularly allowed 16 prime resonance peaks along
with several harmonics. For a microtubule of typical length
10–12 peaks out of 16 are observed. However, statistically,
when Sahu et al. measured microtubules of several lengths
between 200 nm and 24 μm, the overlaps of several peaks
explicitly unraveled 8 original peaks, rests are harmonics.
Microtubule’s length strictly selects the allowed/blocked

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

eight resonance frequencies and the rest eight first harmonics always occur, irrespective of the microtubule length. Sahu
et al. observation suggest that eight variable peaks are coupled
to the universal eight resonance levels whose intensity varies with length. This MHz resonance band has two sub-bands
one in the 10–35 MHz region ~12 MHz (Q ~ 75), ~22 MHz
(Q ~ 46), ~35 MHz (Q ~ 129), ~46 MHz (Q ~ 62). Another
sub-band is in the 100–250 MHz region, ~89 MHz (Q ~ 43),
~144 MHz (Q ~ 75), ~180 MHz (Q ~ 46), ~228 MHz (Q ~ 64).
Here Q ~ Quality factor measured for L = 1 μm, at 300 K,
1 atm. and 90% humidity.
Finally, in the 7–13 GHz domain, microtubule shows
two Gaussian-like resonant transmissions. If microtubule is
pumped at 7 GHz, near 19 GHz we observe a transmission
band, it is a remarkable modulation since the frequency is
amplified by ~3 times. However, for the 13 GHz pumping we
observe another Gaussian-like stochastic resonance, however,
in this case, it peaks around 13 GHz only. Therefore, again,
similar to kHz bands resonance peaks are wide, with low Q
values (Q ~ 1.5, 2).
The electrical resonance is associated with the mechanical oscillations of the single microtubule string. Among three
resonance bands, only MHz band induces visible mechanical
oscillations to the microtubule. Sahu et al. (2013a) investigated further the origin of these three bands. If water channel
is removed from the core of microtubule, the GHz resonance
disappears, if proto-filaments are isolated, kHz resonance
disappears, still, the MHz resonance survives. Therefore, the
GHz resonance is due to the water channel, the 1 Hz–kHz
oscillations are due to the proto-filament oscillations, the
MHz oscillations originate inside the protein structure triggering elastic vibrational modes of the microtubule as predicted by Jiri Pokorny. The kHz oscillation is energetically
insufficient to vibrate thirteen isolated proto-filaments, the
GHz resonance vibrates the water channel, not the hollow
protein cylinder, which MHz vibrations do eloquently.
One fundamental parameter for electromechanical oscillations is the phase modulation. The phase modulation behavior in
the kHz and MHz domain, since the phase difference between
input and the output ac signal in these regions are quantized.
Statistical count of phase difference Φ shows peaks at 0°, 45°,
90°, 135°, and 180°; wherein, each resonance peak is associated
with a distinct Φ. The kHz and GHz bands do not change the
phase of the ac input signal while a quantized phase modulation
by nπ /4 occurs during MHz transmission across the microtubule, thus, in the MHz band, microtubule acts as automated
phase-locked-loop (PLL) oscillator. A phase-locked loop or
phase lock loop (PLL) is a control system that generates an
output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input
“reference” signal. It is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector. The circuit compares the phase of the input signal with the phase of the signal
derived from its output oscillator and adjusts the frequency of
its oscillator to keep the phases matched. The signal from the
phase detector is used to control the oscillator in a feedback
loop. Frequency is the derivative of phase. Keeping the input
and output phase in lockstep implies keeping the input and

155

output frequencies in lockstep. Consequently, a phase-locked
loop or PLL can track an input frequency, or it can generate a
frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency. The former
property is used for demodulation, and the latter property is
used for indirect frequency synthesis.

6.2.3 The Biological Relevance of the Time Crystal
Ten biological relevance’s to a Winfree time crystal
obtained via experimental studies of biomaterials: Winfree
detected spontaneous emergence of singularity in a biological clock (Aldridge and Pavlidis, 1976; Alleva et al., 1971).
Automated creation of a guest clock in the phase perimeter
of a host clock prompted him to connect the emergence of
life with the formation of a time crystal. A time crystal holds
two or more distinct rates of time flow in an orderly fashion.
It means the system can hold and execute an event.
1. The “signal burst or bing” is not important,
silence or phase between the “bings” is important:
Detecting a time crystal has a clear route. Find, if the
resonance frequencies of material remain the same.
Then check if the phase associated with each resonance peak changes with time. It means the materials dielectric property that regulates the resonance
remains unchanged. The geometric parameter of the
material edits the phase to run the clocks. For microtubule, it is the length (Sahu et al., 2013a, 2013b).
By varying it, one finds a change in the intensity and
phase of the peaks but not the resonance frequency
values (Ghosh et al., 2016a). The ratios of phases for
the resonance frequencies determine the geometric shape stored in a microtubule. Similarly, one
can determine the geometric information stored in
the particular conformations of protein’s & their
complexes. Currently a time crystal pens are being
explored that will read the 3D information structure
as time crystal directly from nature.
2. Nesting of clocks was missing in the concept of
time crystal: The existence of time crystals was
verified in the elementary life forms, for decades,
experimentally. However, the nesting of clocks was
never proposed or investigated. Winfree’s idea of a
singular singularity had to be generalized and we
explore that possibility. A time crystal of a virus
vibrates as a single clock. Inside, each plane of lattice oscillates in the period, those are clocks inside
clocks. Inside a plane, each group of atoms vibrates
like a clock. The crystal acts like a clock inside a
clock inside a clock (Shlesinger, 1988). The network has several layers within as the clocks are also
clocked (Edmunds, 1977). Such fractal clocking in
the biomaterials is a recent discovery (Ghosh et al.,
2014a, 2016a). The resonance band of a microtubule.
The phase is flipping spontaneously. However, fractal clocking was reported in the ion channels long
back (Liebovitch et al., 1987).

156

3. Ten geometric resonance properties of biomaterials: Recently, the resonance frequencies and their
associated phases of various biomaterials were measured (Sahu et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2014; Ghosh et al.,
2016a). It shows that the emergence of frequencies
is not random. They follow a unique geometric relationship between them. Here are some features. (a)
Various carriers interfere with resonating with the
biomaterial cavities. Thus, make their distinct band
of resonance frequencies. The experiments show that
the distribution of frequencies is grouped as a triplet
of triplet. It means apparently, there are three bands,
but if one looks within one band, finds three more
sub-bands (notice the kHz, MHz and GHz bands).
(b) Each region of all nine sub-bands contains one
to eight peaks inside, these make biomaterials E1 to
E8 class systems. Biomaterials increase layered subbands but no instance is reported to have more than
eight peaks at the lowest level. (c) The time crystal of
a triplet of triplet band has 72 clocks embedded in the
phase spheres. The diameters of the experimentally
measured Bloch spheres remain the same. Only, their
relative positions change and on the 3D spheres, they
are visible, distinctly. (d) Resonance frequencies are
always associated with the quantized phases. A shift
from quantization in a particular peak’s phase value
is the information. (e) As one move from higher to the
lower frequency range, the scale-free power distribution of the frequency band is observed (Ghosh et al.,
2014a, 2016a). The intensity of the resonance peaks
increases by orders of magnitude. (f) The amount
of material is irrelevant. The geometric parameters,
length, width, pitch and lattice parameters regulate
the self-similarity of arranging the resonance frequencies. (g) Each frequency corresponds to a singularity point (Mallat and Hwang, 1992). The value
of frequency relates to the circle diameter. The frequencies of the resonance peaks would remain static
but not their phase. Using phase one can put system
points at an accurate location on the host phase cycle’s
perimeter. The step secures the relative Bloch sphere
positions. Thus, biomaterials are mathematically precise devices. (h) The time crystal remains intact if the
fundamental geometric parameters remain constant.
Then it is possible to change the system points and
regulate the relative phase or phase shift (Johnsson
et al., 1973). The same time crystal would then store
different information. It is interesting, because,
experimental measurement of detecting resonance
frequencies or phase associated with a peak would
never show the information. We need to measure
specifically the phase shift to see that a biomaterial
is processing information. In the Eukaryotic cells of
the entire kingdom, microtubule rapidly changes its
length (dynamic instability), sometimes its diameters
(6–19 protofilaments), and then its pitch to morph
its shape in incredible ways. Thus, it carries out the

Nanobrain

key tasks of a living life form by editing its topology.
(i) Sometimes, it is necessary to add or deduct some
clocks or resonance frequencies. Then the structure
would change its typically associated symmetry so
that particular singularity points disappear (all phase
values get defined) or new singularity point appears.
Subtracting or adding a singularity point means
destroying the link or creating a link with several
layers of geometries hidden within. (j) The number
of oscillators or the number of devices has no relation to the number of clocks, it is not even related to
the lattice symmetries. The number of lattice symmetries adopted by microtubule is the number of
resonance peaks for a microtubule, not the number
of clocks. Often, spatial symmetry breaking is associated directly with the time symmetry. A composition of lattice symmetries together defines a clock
if they all undergo phase transitions as a group.
In the assembly of clocks, only eight dynamic symmetries repeat (Sahu et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2014). Sahu
et al. have proposed unique fourth-circuit element
Hinductor for artificially demonstrating biological
time crystals and the potential of singularities (Sahu
et al., US patent 9019685B2).
4. The magnetic beating of beats: Electrical beating
occurs when two electromagnetic signals of very
close frequencies interfere. Biological materials
known for producing low magnetic fields (10−10 T)
could generate beating locally in the lattice. Then
the beat signals could interfere again if the smaller
lattice domain is part of a larger structure. The beating of beats could beat again and such layered structures are rich in biology. Thus, one observes that
beating signals cover the entire electromagnetic or
magnetic frequency domain (Jaynes, 1980; Reddy
et al., 2018). Such a hierarchical network of beating
requires simultaneous switching off the topological
constraints at all level to destroy signaling. Thus, all
signals survive together at ambient conditions.
5. Harvesting thermal, electrical and electromagnetic noise: Time crystals in biomaterials reveal its
unique phase relationship in the presence of noise
(Betz and Chance, 1965a), one could use the noise
trick inspired by biology to read the time crystals.
Thermal noise compensation is rich in biology
(Brinkmann, 1971), clocks neutralize the thermal
noise (Bruce and Pittendrigh, 1956; Fuller et al.,
1978; Hastings et al., 1957). Thermal pulses could
even activate the biological clocks (Engelmann et al.,
1974). Harvesting noise for filtering the frequency
response by a synaptic junction is already reported
(Brunel et al., 2001). The origin of electrical ionic
activity is attributed to oscillatory potentials in
biology (Brown et al., 1975). Even the electromagnetic pulses of a light edit the biological clocks
(Engelmann et al., 1973). However, ordered signals
affect the infrared photon absorption in biosystems.

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

Signal inhibits the noise conversion to resonanceinduced interference. It affects the nested beating
described above (Sahu et al., US patent 9019685B2).
Among all frequency domains, bio-systems absorb
most in the infra-red domain.
6. Harvesting singularity to self-assemble clocks:
Learning, communication, all forms of information processing in neuron occurs via time crystals
If one knows feedback path accurately, predicting the
emergence of singularity is an easy task (Johnsson
and Karlsson, 1971; Mallat and Hwang, 1992).
Energy transmission is studied following a unique
biological route, bottom-up. Protein ↔ microfilaments ↔ bundle inside neurons (branches) ↔
bundles of neurons in a cortical column. It suggests
that a neuron edits the phase of a transmission signal by modifying the neural branches (Reddy et al.,
2018; Ghosh et al., 2016a; Jenerick, 1963). The effort
changes the stored geometric structure of the neurons time crystal, surprisingly, Ghosh et al. claimed
it explicitly in 2016, some old results were very near
to it (Buhusi and Meck, 2005). A neuron may take
two steps. If a neuron builds a new branch, it creates a new clock. Else, it locally modifies an existing
branch. That edits the phase of an old clock. Thus, a
change in the structure does not mean the creation of
a new clock or singularity. Neurons communicate by
clocking ionic pulses (Gerisch et al., 1975), but the
evidence of wavelike communication is also there
(Hill, 1933) apart from Ghosh et al. work in 2016.
After the creation of a new branch, the system spontaneously investigates two factors. First, whether
the phase modification is required in the new clock.
Second, whether the new clock is integrated into a
suitable location in the existing time crystal.
		 Similar to neuron, protein, microfilament and neurofilaments, assemblies inside the neural branches and
cortical column edit their own time crystals (Noctor
et al., 2004). The modified time crystals continuously edit their physical structure (Van Essen, 1997).
The greater neural pattern in size often dominates in
the higher-level (slower) clocks in the time crystal
(Xue et al., 2010). Following the magnetic beating
of beats all forms of vibrations are topologically connected in the brain. Electromagnetically this would
have never been possible, as the electromagnetic signal damps in the cell fluids. Consequently, the proposal that a brain is a single resonance chain (Ghosh
et al., 2016a; Basar, 1990) is a primitive one, Reddy
et al. add that the brain is a time crystal, resonance
chain is a limited view ignoring the topology of phase.
7. A non-linear correspondence between the spatial
and temporal assembly of crystals: Even a tubulin
protein molecule is a time crystal. It self-assembles
into another time crystal, microtubule. Then microtubules self-assemble into a bundle to build the core
structure of a neuron, e.g., an axon. Neurons respond

as time crystal (Buhusi and Meck, 2005), a bundle of
neurons forms a cortical column that is also a time
crystal. The bundle of cortical columns also acts as a
time crystal. A secondary structure of protein ~2–5
picometer to 1 mm cortical column, the spatial journey is about 107 orders. However, the temporal scale
regulation is from pico-seconds to seconds, 1012
orders (Ghosh et al., 2014a). The parameter that regulates the phase relation of various resonance peaks
is geometric. Tubulin’s each of the eight conformations holds a particular set of geometry. Similarly,
microtubule’s different length, lattices hold suitable
symmetries. Neuron’s branches edit their own symmetries spontaneously. The cortical columns length
and symmetries of neuron locations edit their own
symmetries. In association with the spatial symmetries the phase relationship changes together causing
a ripple effect in the temporal symmetries. The resonance frequencies remain nearly unchanged, yet
107 order time crystal gets changed by 1012 spatial
scale changes. One cannot isolate a particular part
of a time crystal. To hold memory various clocks
only use the phase space, together, thus information is stored everywhere simultaneously.
8. Interacting with the living cells and proteins in
their own language: The biological structures sense
a phase connected time crystal network better than
conventional sensors. A sensor absorbs the existence
of a signal burst. Biomaterials senses not just phase
links between several such bursts, but exactly the pattern following which those links change with time.
When 7–8 days old hippocampal neurons were given
a specific set of frequencies as time crystal, wirelessly. The suitable neuron, responded. No searching
is required for searching for a suitable time crystal.
Electric or electromagnetic signaling faces the effect
of a physical boundary of a material. However, the
magnetic beating of beats do not face boundary, it
integrates by a phase map with everything within a
magnetic shield. So, communication does not happen as also observed in electrical or electromagnetic
communication scenario. It was predicted in 2014, as
a spontaneous reply (Ghosh et al., 2014a). Moreover,
it was possible to encode geometric shapes in a neuron. Talking to neurons is possible in its own language (GML, Agrawal et al., 2016b). Even treating
misfolding of proteins are possible by twisting the
time crystals (Sahu et al., 2014).
9. Clocking integration of resonances: Various
kinds of resonances are not isolated events: A list
of published resonance frequencies show that the
ratios between different frequencies are not integers. Even they are not harmonic. They are anharmonic (Ghosh et al., 2016a; Monserrat et al., 2013).
The ratio of magnetic resonance frequencies is the
golden ratio (phi~1.61...). If the fundamental frequency is f o then the other sets of frequencies would

158

be f o , ∅f o , ∅ 2 f o , ∅3 f o … ∅ n f o , The electromagnetic resonance frequencies occur at the ratio of pi;
f o , π f o , π 2 f o , π 3 f o … π n f o ,. While mechanical resonances occur at ratios of e, f o , ef o , e 2 f o , e3 f o ⊃ e n f o .
All three resonances are related by a quadratic relationship e 2 + φ 2 = π 2. By following this equation,
the biomaterials ensure integration of electromagnetic and magnetic resonances deliver regularized
mechanical changes in the system. There is a clocking integration even between three different kinds of
resonances. It also justifies the fractal information
theory, FIT, where all topologies were filled in a
circle or topology.
10. Clocking Phase sphere holds the geometric locations of singularities: The experiments confirmed
that the proteins clock like a time crystal, though
similar claims were made in the 1970s. At that time,
technology was not that advanced to provide a piece
of direct evidence. To be a time crystal, any system’s
resonance frequencies should change their phase as
if three clocks are part of one phase cycle. A single
system point while completing a full rotation 360°
would find that all constituent clocks do not delay it,
or let it finish full rotation early. Thus, one has to
check if the change of phases of clocking frequencies
are quantized. If yes, it is probably a time crystal. Six
proteins associated with the neuron firing showed
time crystal features. Tubulin, beta spectrin, actin,
ankyrin, clathrin and SNARE complex. Clocking
of phase appears to be a universal property of proteins. During clocking, they hold specific geometric
shapes. We repeat that a clocking Bloch sphere holding the geometric shapes made of singularity points
was proposed as the basic information structure of
nature in FIT (Reddy et al., 2018).
6.2.3.1 Exponential Speedup of Time Crystal
Transfer via Synchrony—Quantum
Entanglement Is Not the Only Route
A time crystal consists of phase, frequency and delay, however, the nature of locking could vary. The mathematical formulation for the individual locking process is similar, here
we demonstrate the exponential speedup for phase locking.
Synchronization of oscillators means that all basic computing
oscillators should fire at the same time, when pumped by an
ac signal; therefore, the phase is locked for all oscillators.
Time crystal clusters of different sizes mean neuronoscillators of different sizes, synchronization continues for
all clusters simultaneously. Say, we pump a single neuronoscillator holding an “if-then” time crystal, or a neuroncluster holding a large number of time crystals with an ac
signal, the dynamics of one time crystal oscillator among N
(neuron-oscillators or neuron-clusters), in the neighborhood
is given by dVi dt = S0 − γ Vi , where, 0 ≤ Vi ≤ 1 and i = 1,, N
(Mirollo and Strogatz, 1990). Here, γ is the dissipation factor, S0 is the threshold bias required for the time crystalholding-neuron to fire energy to its neighboring neurons,

Nanobrain

which are also holding distinct time crystals. The rate of
change of potential of a single neuron-oscillator or clusteroscillator is not identical, though a neuron representing a
time crystal could be part of different clusters of time crystals of similar and different sizes. Rise and decay of potential are identical for individual neuron-oscillators, however,
for each non-identical cluster it is different. When a neuronoscillator or a neuron-cluster fire, it pulls all neighboring
neuron’s or similar neuron-cluster voltage up by an amount
ε , or pulls them up to firing whatever is less for the neuron
oscillator. Note that Vi = 1, means neurons or clusters fire;
and then the neuron or cluster switches to Vi = 0. Note that,
during the synchronization process, while adding potential
amount ε , only those clusters respond, at the same time,
which has similar rise and decay rates.
To generate synchronization, voltage variation in the
single neuron or cluster assembly is defined as a function f (ϕ ) = V and we take its inverse function to carry out
mapping during the energy exchange process. Here ϕ is
the phase variable, hence, dϕ dt = 1 T = υ , where, T is the
time period. At ϕ = 0 at Vi = 0. Thus, f (0) = 0 and f (1) = 1
. It should be noted that we define synchrony is locked when
oscillators re-arrange themselves in such a position, such
that, if one neuron or neuron-cluster is pumped and fires,
a single fire will bring all other similar neurons or clusters
into the threshold. Moreover, this is also important to note
that once this happens, synchrony does not break afterward,
since internal dynamics for all oscillators are similar, they
remain synchronized. The modified potential ε is added to
the existing potential of the neuron or the neuron-cluster only
for those, which have similar rise and decay rates of potential. Therefore the selection of clusters with similar internal
dynamics starts from the very beginning of synchronization.
The little energy contribution ε is transported at the speed
of light to the other neurons and clusters; hence, it appears
simultaneous one-to-many and many-to-one communication. Since for the artificial brain, identification of coupled
time crystals is the process of solution making, the concern
that during ε addition, important clusters might be discarded
by accident does not arise. The reason is that ε addition is
repeated continuously, along with the phase modulation,
no neuron-time crystal or cluster-time crystal is discarded/
selected in one-step, if the clusters or time crystals fail to
cope up with the phase modulation, then only they are discarded in subsequent steps of synchronization.
Say, at t = t0, neuron or a cluster A fires, at this point of
time, B neuron or a cluster has the phase ϕ . After a time 1− ϕ ,
neuron or cluster B reaches the threshold. By this time, neuron
or cluster A has changed its phase, from zero to a value given
by θ = f (1 − ϕ ) . After some times, B fires and then θ jumps to
ε + f (1 − ϕ ) or 1, whichever is less. A and B neurons or clusters
synchronize if θ = 1, so we consider, it is not achieved yet. Then
the phase of A is g ε + f (1 − ϕ ) ~ h (ϕ ). In summary, two
of the oscillators make the journey from ( 0,ϕ B ) to h (ϕ ) , 0 ,
we get h′ (ϕ ) = − g′ ε + f (1 − ϕ ) g′ f (1 − ϕ ) = −λ . If we
consider, u = f (1 − ϕ ), we get, g′ ( ε + u ) g′ ( u ) = λ , whose
solution is of the form, g′(u) = ae bu.

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

The appearance of exponential variation is fundamentally
important, since, an extension of this calculation leads us to
the time for synchronization, and that is exponentially fast in
k, where k is the number of iteration. If ∆ k = ϕk − ϕ ′ , denotes
the distance from repelling fixed point ϕ ′, we get ∆ k = ∆ 0λ 2 k .
The synchrony takes place in the system of a neuron or cluster
oscillators when ϕk is driven to either 0 or 1. The number of
iterations required for synchronization is k ≈ O (1 ε b ln1 ∆ 0 ),
where b is a constant that appears during differential equation solution, and higher are the values of ε , b, ∆ 0 faster is synchronization. In designing the brain like a computer, we have
tried to keep ∆ 0 high, and for the typical design of the artificial
neuron or the elementary oscillator, ε ,b acquire high values.
More is the coupling, higher is the value of ε , since artificial
neurons and clusters communicate via resonance frequency,
the dissipation factor b is always very high. Synchrony is a
co-operative phenomenon between coupling and dissipation,
and the mathematical expression noted above parametrically
accounts the co-operation explicitly during computation.
Mean-field model for all to all coupling: Kuramoto
proposed in 1975, that θn = ωn − KN −1 ∑ m sin(θ n − θ n+ m ), ωn
is taken from symmetric distribution of g(ω ) , here the order
parameter is Ψ = N −1 ∑ n rneiθn = Reiθ , rn = 1. Synchronization
occurs if R ≠ 0, complete sync state means R=1. Partially synchronized state means 0 ≤ R ≤ 1.
Logarithmic reduction of the number of computing step
is feasible for such synchronization, since ∆ 0 is proportional
to the number of oscillators or neuron-clusters (say N ) taking part in the synchronization process. The magnitude of ∆ 0
is determined by the difference between the point of reflection and the initial phase. When the number of oscillators N
increases, dN number of oscillators fix their typical ∆ 0 to a
particular value. More is the value of N , higher is the value
of dN and during synchronization, as the time increases,
a number of oscillators losses randomness ( −dN ); hence,
dN = −kNdt . Thus, we get exponentially faster synchronization as the number of oscillators or neuron-clusters increase
during computation. For a group of input time crystal-clusters,
∆ 0 initially increases and eventually reaches equilibrium, then
the synchronization steps become independent of the number
of oscillators taking part in the process.
6.2.3.2 Tubulin’s Nested Resonance and Synchrony
The rapid collapse of tubulins into microtubule nanowire with
femtosecond pulses (Tulub, 2004; Sahu et al., 2015) and thereafter under a nanosecond, and microsecond pulses suggest a
strong electromagnetic coupling between tubulins in 1010
time scales (10−15 sec to 10−6 sec). It is not unlikely as proteins
vibrate from milliseconds to femtoseconds, wide time ranges
at a time (Hamm, 2008).
Quantum tunneling images of a microtubule (Sahu et al.,
2015) shows wave functions of eight eigenstates of 8 quantum wells, a dimer’s 8 quantum wells and a monomer shows
8 quantum wells. Totally, by combining three resonance frequencies in three different domains, a microtubule could hold
a 3-bit long 512 eigenstates each with distinct wave functions.
Thus, each eigenstate has distinct observables, as expected in

159

MBL. A protein at 300 K is not in thermal equilibrium, kT
heats up every single quasi-particle in the 512 quantum wells,
but they redistribute heat via many-body localization (MBL),
they do not self-thermalize, states keep localized, no spin
or energy transport (crypto equilibrium, looks like T = 0).
Entanglement is low and distributed over time. Eigenstates
are fully localized product-states, DC conductivity is zero
(1015 Ω, a nearly perfect insulator) at 300 K as expected in
MBL. Correlated phase distribution suggests MBL. Since
quantum tunneling images of a dimer does not show an intricate pattern of wells obvious in a monomer, and quantum
tunneling images of a microtubule does not show any sign
of dimer’s symmetry, all dimers could be represented using
quantum-like wavefunctions.
From the concept of area entanglement, we get edge state
where from we get differential conductance dI ⁄dV = e ^ 2 ⁄ν h,
from which we get ν = 5 / 2 , which is then related to e / 4, as
we observe the change by ne / 4. For Hinductor one should
not use dI dV, rather should use dQ dΨ. It was theoretically
conjectured that ν = 5 / 2 abelian state has fractional charge
e / 4. One could theoretically show that the quantum oscillation that is generated over there could have a fractional
charge. Extensive measurements need to be carried out in the
future on Hinductors to find the topological charges, though
Sahu et al. measured that it is e / 4.
Quantum wells of tubulin and microtubule: Quasiparticles are not real particles, they are the density of states
formed by the interaction of force fields behaving as a particle
or showing wave–particle duality. Oscillating quasi-particles
generated by dipolar oscillations of alfa helices and their
infra-red quantum energy exchange (Panman et al., 2015)
inside one of the eight quantum wells (~0.3 nm wide) of a
2 nm wide tubulin monomer dwells for a longer time before
leaking through. Thus, each well in a monomer generates a
wave u = e ^ iωt, similar to a capacitor which reflects through
the wall, changes its phase like an inductor and we get a wave
v = e ^ ( −iωt ), moving in the same direction. Both the waves
generated on the same well barrier, at the same time, satisfy2
2
ing normalization u + v = 1. Tunneling images of a dimer
shows a C2 symmetry, hence both the 2 nm wide quantum
droplets are part of a singular wave function, Ψ = u 0 + v 0
represents a well. Coherent emission from a monomer under
laser argue that it is a single quantum well, made of eight
sub-quantum well’s inside. More degeneracy, longer mean
free path; for the quantum well inside a monomer mean free
path is 4 >> 0.3 nm. Thus, the potential fluctuation of noise at
GHz in a monomer creates a damped oscillation, periodic in
potential, a strict function of monomer’s area. Characteristic
vibration of the amide group gives rise to parallel and perpendicular bands. Consequently, generated a 2D infrared signature of alfa-helices suggests that a monomer’s quantum well’s
surface area on the water crystal cylinder changes as the number of active quantum well changes in the tunneling image
as a function of applied ac frequency. Thus, a monomer’s
entropy is a function of its area, a first precursor to manybody localization, MBL. Applied noise through water channel
drains free charge, ions, free electrons, so microtubule has

160

zero DC conductivity, the second precursor to MBL. Due to
17 nm wide water crystal cylinder, thin protein sheet does
not require “external heat bath,” it serves as its own bath, a
third precursor to MBL.
Beyond a threshold gate bias, microtubule’s capacitance
decreases to a quantum capacitance, but it needs additional
ac signal to maximize inductance to quantum inductance.
When both the conditions are set, and water crystal continues to drain out the free charges, we get a transition from an
eigenstate thermalizing Phase (ETP) to quantum resonance.
Quantum inductance and quantum capacitance are masked
by classical parameters, only when higher than a certain gate
bias is applied one can detect quantum ripples and associated
quantum capacitance. Similarly, only when a certain range of
ac frequency is applied, one could see a saturation of inductance with frequency, that value is quantum inductance. Thus,
the quantum property of such quantum resonators is visible
only under certain circumstances.

6.3 SINGLE MOLECULE’S THERMAL DIFFUSION
EMERGES INTO A NATURAL CLOCK
Zhingulin’s simulation of brain’s central nervous system (CNS): One major problem for the realization of an
artificial central nervous system, CNS is that the statistical
methods allow solving the dynamic problems in an infinite
size network. However, they are not applicable to realistic CNS like networks where constituent sub-networks
regulate operation using periodic and chaotic dynamics.
Recently, V. P. Zhigulin has proposed a theoretical model
solving this problem (Zhigulin, 2004), however its information storage and memory processing are not addressed
explicitly. In complementary work, White et al. have demonstrated clearly how a network’s storage capacity for temporal memory scales with system size. Therefore, together,
these works may provide a comprehensive solution to the
problem as extensively outlined by Bandyopadhyay et al.
(2009a, 2009b).
Shannon’s entropy (SE) for information exchange between
the molecules connected molecular electronics (ME) and
information entropy (MESE). Calculation of information
entropy and Shannon entropy: First, we formulate SE for any
dynamic molecular system, which is applicable to any multilevel neural components. At any given time, say N number of
Duroquinone, DRQ molecules occupying 0, 1, 2, 3 states randomly are separated by ~9 nm on the Au (111) surface. If more
than three molecules are brought into the region of 9 nm in
diameter then they never collapse into an integrated assembly,
rather collectively generate a distribution of logic states spontaneously (Figure 6.5a–e). Then as the molecular diversity or
conformer M is 4, the maximum information registered from
Shannon expression is SE = lne ( M N ) ~ 5.52 nats for N = 4
molecules. Then information for one molecule represent other
N−1 molecules, the system can have only four distinct information. Therefore, Shannon’s information registration limit is
significantly reduced to 1.39 nats.

Nanobrain

In the sub-monolayer, DRQs move and exchange logic
state collectively, and taking those numbers we can construct a matrix with elements equal to the number of DDQs
involved in the exchange process. Information in this
matrix or string is studied using Shannon entropy equation H (V ) = −∑ iN=−01 pi log2 pi one could determine the average minimum number of bits required to encode a string
or matrix (H), based on their frequency of occurrence
(pi). Here, pi is the frequency of a particular logic state
Pi = PNDR (V ) * PNeu (V ). PNDR is the probability of a state
generated by NDR with a Gaussian
peak at the threshold
2
2
bias Vth PNDR = (2πσ 2 )−1/ 2 e −(Vth −V ) / 2πσ , here σ is (2π )−1/ 2.
PNeu is the probability of logic state caused by wireless interaction of molecules, by considering sigmoid Boltzman
neuron, PNeu = (1 + e S /C )−1, where S is the weighted sum of
N −1
input signals, S = ∑ i =1 xi wi + w0, xi is the distance between
interacting molecules, wi is an energy difference between
them, w0 is energy induced by external bias V, w0 = xrmsV.
C is typical of a substrate and temperature, sets a limiting
value of S, less than that logic states change (S ~ 60). Inside
CNS a neuron may have 10,000 inputs and 10,000 outputs;
here one-to-many variable weak and strong wireless wiring
among clusters enables mimicking the continuous firing of
a real neural net.
The temporary memory storage capacity of a DRQ neural
network is determined during a continuous logic state exchange
process of participants inside an ED wave boundary. First,
matrices produced by the natural exchange are recorded, and
then the same procedure is repeated by scanning at higher
biases or forcefully changing one DDQ’s state. Finally,
the memory function m(k) ( m ( k ) = α k /α k + ε 1 (1 − α k +1 ) )
is plotted by Bandyopadhyay et al. (2009a) with the fraction of the input signals survived k/N, (k = 0, 1, 2…N, here
N = 4) within the symmetric region, where α varies from 0
to 1, ε is the variance constant and ε 1 = ε / (1 − α ). When the
change in connectivity of the neural net is plotted with time
by Bandyopadhyay et al. it shows that even if DRQs acquire
states randomly, their motion is always confined within a
sphere of diameter ~ number of molecule × dimension of a
molecule. For N = 2, 3, 4 molecules for a given input logic
set, N input—N output neural net is realized. To develop a
general operational model, we consider that a DRQ neuron
will produce a particular output with the fourth power of the
sigmoid probability function.
Quantum Boltzmann machine’s molecular version:
As classical QBMs have N input—one output configuration,
to model an N input—N output neuron device, N number of
independent QBM nets are parallelly coupled. Considering
homogeneous coupling, the results of one QBM is extrapolated to an N input N output neural net,–a generalized parallel processor of the present formulation. Bandyopadhyay
et al. have plotted the probability of particular distribution
with the ratio of input energy and exchange interaction coefficient for 4 DRQ neurons. These parameters are calculated
as output of a QBM, where all molecules interact following a
Hubbard model (spin is replaced by an imaginary electronic

with same interaction coefficients. Results confirm stochastic sigmoid nature of quantum coupling among DRQ neurons during a random exchange of logic states. The sigmoid
nature leads to a collective logical output of the N, N processing surface, which is an essential requirement to practically realize Zhingulin and White et al. brain function and
neural network theories.
In conclusion, an expression to calculate Shannon’s
entropy (SE) for information processing in molecular
electronics (ME) is formulated. The MESE formulation is
applied in analyzing dynamic/chaotic motifs (Zhingulin)
that are responsible for the survival of temporary memory
(White) in a 2 D neural network. The output of the network
could be the geometric structures that would reflect the
computing output (Figure 6.5f–h). In a naturally formed
thermodynamically quasi-closed system, DRQ based N

input and N output neural network are found essential for
emergent logical operations (Figure 6.5i). The operation
has now been extended for 730 molecules where a single
molecule processes 16-bit information, which increases the
processing capability of existing QBM by several orders.
The present formulation could readily be used in verifying
several fundamental formulations proposed in neural network theories. The journey begins with the realization of
a neural net generated by spontaneous interactions of four
molecular neurons.

6.4 BRAIN’S FMRI IMAGES CREATED
ON A MOLECULAR SURFACE
Bandyopadhyay et al. (2010c) used the DDQ molecules
to carry out brain-like computing on an organic bi-layer

shown in Figure 6.5c. On the surface using random rules and
emergence of cellular automaton one could generate patterns
like that we see in the fMRI images (Figure 6.6d). The monolayers could have self-healing properties that could be used to
emulate the brain plasticity (Figure 6.6e). DDQ monolayer has
“self-healing” properties, due to this particular property from
some other parts of the monolayer, molecules enter into the
surface, and they adjust positions to recover. The most interesting thing is that, even if this happens, the computing does
not stop, and it continues, the evolution of patterns do not care
whether a single cell is there or not. Molecular cellular automaton promises to speed up or slow down events to compute
and deliver output at the conceivable time (Figure 6.6f). We
discuss below in details.

6.5 MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTING
BY CELLULAR AUTOMATON
Nature exhibits sophisticated collective information processing capabilities that show similarities to our brain, the
reproduction of multi-cellular organisms, and so on. In this
context, global co-ordination emerges from the decentralized
communication between simple components. The particular
feature has important advantages over man-made supercomputers where a central unit explicitly controls all computation
processes. The first advantage is that all functional parts no
longer need to be connected to the central control via physical wiring in order to increase the speed (~10 km wiring/cm2
area of an integrated chip). The second advantage is that the

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

loss of connection with a central control unit will not jeopardize the entire system, thus making it more robust. The third
advantage is that the allocated resources are equally divided.
In the past such wireless and powerless computation have
been proposed in the theoretical models of cellular automata, CA. The biggest challenge in theoretical CA cell is that
by changing the update scheme, one can get new patterns
(H. Huberman, PNAS, 90, 7716 (1993)), in experimental terms, painfully, majority of theories become useless
(Figure 6.6g–j).
Cellular automation may be used to model artificial
life that follows defining characteristics of living systems.
Bandyopadhyay et al. (2010a, 2010b, 2010c) demonstrated
the existence of such artificial life forms as a logic pattern
that evolves in hundreds of molecules in a molecular layer.
The layer consists of DDQ molecules that reversibly switch
between four states. A molecule may change states of its
six (or, depending on the local network configuration: four)
neighbors at a time following particular transition rules for
the birth, survival and death of cells and thus create a new
electron transport circuit for a new problem. The way patterns
change over time is thus strongly dependent on their arrangement on the molecular layer, and we have especially observed
this for two types of patterns, i.e., linear and circular patterns.
For the first, the pattern changes over time as if electrons diffuse throughout the surface, and for the second the pattern
changes as if normal tissue cells mutate continuously to give
rise to cancer cells. Concentric circular rings are good for the
coupled differential equations, the number of rings will reflect
how many equations are coupled, and separations between
two rings will determine boundary conditions. Similarly, a
pair of straight lines is good for the higher-order differentials.
It should be noted that even a small change in the input pattern could turn the computation toward a completely different
direction, and this happens more frequently, if we deal with
small patterns. The surface computes more reliably when one
encodes basic equations with the larger size. To encode the
boundary condition relative ratio is important, so there is basically no restriction on the absolute size (US patent 4809202).
DDQ molecular assembly (Figure 6.7a) remarkably selects
CA rules for its universe as required and adapts itself to a
new situation by tuning the space and time limits. It has been
a custom until now to define new CA rules every time we
wanted to solve a new problem. Here, the CA adopts itself
to solve more than one problem in single hardware, which is
an essential criterion to build a universal computer like the
one we use in our daily life. Even though it is the first practical CA, its universality could be generalized further paving the way for massively parallel processor envisioned by
Neumann 50 years back. Moreover, the differential equation system is created on the monolayer, it is not the creation
of CA models using partial differential equations as practiced frequently (Doeschi et al., 2004; Omohundro, 1984).
These two approaches are fundamentally opposite concepts
as noted earlier (Toffoli, 1984).

163

Sinusoidal, exponential or logarithmic functions are
encoded using closed patterns of very small sizes, for example, completely packed smaller circles grow exponentially,
and if outside regions of large circles are closed they collapse exponentially. Thus, one can encode both positive and
negative exponentials. Flower-shaped triangular circles are
good for sinusoidal functions, while concentric triangles
with only angular points encode the logarithmic functions.
It should be noted that coupling of functions with the differentials is done by placing them in a very particular manner on the surface. The additive and multiplicative coupling
are done by placing the interactive patterns side-by-side on
the surface and enclosing one inside the other respectively.
The relative separations determine the boundary conditions
and for that particular reason, we can encode wide ranges
of computing problems on the monolayer. It also tells us
about the limitations of this kind of computing. For example, one could easily ask, Δx and Δt have upper and lower
limits therefore, the PPM-GML-H triad computing cannot
be universal, one can encode only a particular kind of problems. In the case of two natural differential equations solved
here, diffusion equation and coupled differential equations,
Bandyopadhyay et al. have shown to encode spatial and temporal differentials (Figure 6.7a, b). We have also discussed
tuning time and space, which is squeezed by orders of magnitude. For example, charge decay and diffusion that takes
only a few picoseconds could be increased to the second’s
domain (Figure 6.7c–e), and cancer cell evolution that takes
100 years (Figure 6.7f–h), or astrological events that take
a million years could be speeded up by the same orders of
magnitude. Computing is not restricted by Δx and Δt physical constraints of the monolayer hardware, since patterns
irrespective of its natural speed follows a particular spatial
evolution, since time is linked with space, it was possible to
replicate events that are orders different in time.
For each particular input pattern, Bandyopadhyay et al.
observed spontaneous flipping of weak bonds between molecules, building a new communication circuit by creating
and destroying several optional paths connecting hundreds of
cells. Building a new circuit turns it creative, simply because
the total number of circuits that could be generated for a particular kind of problem is nearly infinite. Unlike supercomputers, the hardware itself talks to multiple cells at a time,
corrects an error in the process, and thus it exhibits a form of
intelligence. During execution, the exchange of an electron
or a few kilo-calories of energy enables wireless computation with minimum external power supply. While a Pentium
IV processor with a device density of <109/cm2 dissipates
approximately 100 W/cm2, the DDQ-HCA (HCA = hexagonal cellular automaton) with a device density of 1014/cm2
dissipates approximately 1 W/cm2; thus heat generation is
significantly minimized. In principle, a solution is generated
collectively, so even if some cells stop working suddenly, the
entire computation does not collapse, but rather the system
reaches a solution.

6.6 ONE-TO-MANY AND MANY-TO-ONE
ORBITAL COMPUTING
IN A NANOWHEEL
In the year 2008, one of the finest philosophies of computer
science, sequentialization was challenged by a simple molecular experiment (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008). If one puts
16 DRQ molecules along a line, if one instruction is given
to a molecule which is at first in the queue, only one decision
would be there as an output. However, if all 16 molecules are
put in a circular array (Figure 6.8a), with a molecule in its center, the story changes significantly. The molecule that resides
at the center of the circle becomes a simultaneous controller of all 16 molecules. So, using an atomic sharp needle one

could change the state of the central molecule and simultaneously observe the change of the states of the 16 neighboring
molecules using a scanning tunneling microscope. The experiment compares directly, what happens if the communications
happen sequentially and simultaneously. Due to the orbital
coupling, 16 molecules could exhibit 4 million solutions
when placed in a circular geometry (Figure 6.8b). However,
the linear arrangement would deliver only one solution. Oneto-many and many-to-one communication could change the
way we believe communication might happen in nature.
All the 16 molecules in the ring simultaneously reply to the
query made by the central molecule, no one needs to be asked
who rings the bell. There is a truth table, but that table has
no limit, just like the fractal logic gate where a small part of

alternate molecule moves forward and backward to keep separation. Second one’s ring holds alternate DRQ molecules have oxygen atoms
up and down (ALCLP). The third one ring DRQs are arranged such that their DRQ molecule located side by side is diagonally arranged, so
the distance between oxygen molecules are increased (PRPRP). The fourth one (FRBRKT), one alternate DRQ stands vertically, oxygen at
bottom. The fifth one has one DRQ vertical and one horizontal, pair of molecules, located side by side on the ring are perpendicular to each
other. Sixth one FRBKCLP has neighboring pair oriented perpendicularly but, vertically oriented DRQs all along the ring is oriented like
a single waveform. The seventh one has (E90FB) all DRQs in the ring vertical, oxygen-oxygen axis is perpendicular and oriented directing
to the Au surface.

the solution (Ghosh et al., 2015b) could be expanded forever.
Sixteen molecular motors could be connected to the system
(Figure 6.8c) and the 8 distinct arrangements of DRQ molecules could hold and operate simultaneously 8 new motors
(Figure 6.8d).

6.7 HIDDEN COMMUNICATION IN THE
FILAMENTS WELL BEFORE A NERVE SPIKE
The fundamental problem with the “neuron skin is everything” model: Hodgkin Huxley model that experimentally
proved that neuron skin is doing everything for the firing, now,

after 70 years, demands are mounting for an alternate route
(McCormick et al., 2007). Most sincere adventures to rectify
sub-threshold communication errors in Hodgkin Huxley were
developed in the 1990s and subsequently ignored since they
were complicated, did not give freedom to play with human
free will (Guckenheimer and Labouriau, 1993). The imaging
of neural events has been one of the hallmarks of neurophysiology, either by chemically neutralizing the ion channels,
doping fluorescent molecules. Thus far the single ion channels which are roughly 0.4 nm were mapped by using a much
larger nanoprobe (Zhou et al., 2015; Ide et al., 2002; Fua et al.,
2014) or indirectly seen by the fluorescent doped channel

166

proteins (Yamamura et al., 2015); wherein the silent ion channels remain undetected (Bal et al., 2008; Ulbrich and Isacoff,
2007). Composition of ion channels, i.e., the stoichiometry
and arrangement of these subunits are required for precise
balance of speed and sensitivity to achieve optimal performance (Zheng et al., 2003; Trudeau and Zagotta, 2002). In the
functional stoichiometry of ion channels, the sub-units are
seen (MacKinnon et al., 1993), yet, how all these events are
linked, such questions are not asked in neuroscience. Second,
the existing ion-channel scanners (Hansma et al., 1989) cannot link a millisecond nerve impulse with the microsecond
or nanosecond protein oscillations, a three-order time gap
remains unbridged. Scanning the ions is so powerful that it
can image even proteins inside a cell (Shevchuk et al., 2006).
Interestingly, the microsecond or nanosecond time-domain
electromagnetic resonance of proteins is being measured
since the 1930s (Elliott and Williams, 1939; Pethig, 1979;
Vollmer et al., 2002; Schirò et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2008;
Verma and Daya, 2017), it is much older than the millisecond
ionic resonance of proteins that was seen experimentally in
the 1980s, though ionic spike was theoretically proposed in
1907. Dielectric resonance microscopy is recent, it images the
cells internal structures, but identifying components by image
contrast is not done yet. Since the biomaterials are insulators,
non-conducting, if an electromagnetic signal is pumped, it
reflects with a coefficient S11, and transmits a part of it at
specific frequencies with a coefficient S21. Every insulator
has a specific signature of resonance frequencies, S21, S11, so
the ions, helices, secondary structures of proteins, DNA etc.
Various cells were imaged by mapping S11, S21 thus far, but
not the neurons.
A few unexplained phenomena of neuroscience: Initially
in the 1930s it was wave of a very different nature regulating
nerve activity (Hill, 1933); by 1946, it was chemical excitation
in the neuron (Brink et al., 1946), then it became electrical
in 1952 and electromagnetic in the 1990s. Bursts of soma or
cell body of a neuron are considered as a unit of information
(Lisman, 1997). However, it is not known how backpropagation when a nerve spike runs in the opposite direction (Scott
et al., 2007), how does the multi-modal actional potentials
survive (Chen et al., 2002). Eventually forward and backward
transmissions interact and various modes of neurotransmitter
releasing processes are activated, like synchronous, asynchronous and spontaneous release (Kaeser and Regehr, 2014). Two
opposite directional transmission causes a clock or periodic
oscillation; thus, clocks are born (Connor, 1978). It is also difficult to explain how multiple threshold potentials exist in the
neuron firing (Sardi et al., 2017), unless we consider quantized
multi-mode resonance of microtubule and actin, biologically
proposed (Zaromytidou, 2012) and experimentally demonstrated in pristine microtubule (Sahu et al., 2013a, 2013b) and
in the neuron (Ghosh et al., 2016a).
However, precisely editing the density of ion channels
alone is trivial (Smith, 2009) even in the 1 m (dorsal root ganglion) to 30 m long axons (Abe et al., 2004). Each part of a
neural branch, irrespective of its length, should have geometrically adjusted composition of ion channels, else, a neural

Nanobrain

spike would distort and fade out (Cavanagh, 1984). If axon
is >1 cm (Ofer and Shefi, 2016), more difficult it is to supply
the metabolic components in time (Cavanagh, 1984) for ionic
pulse to flow (velocity of axon potential is 0.1 or 100 m−1
(myelinated), but the vesicle transport velocity is ~10 μm−1,
(supply is 3 orders slower; Kulić et al., 2008), the thermodynamic cost at all levels do not match, which is currently
believed to be the unifying principle governing bio-systems
(Hasenstaub et al., 2010). A membrane of an entire neuron
cell is short-circuited, no sensor to estimate the geometry of
complex branches yet a membrane does not allow a spike to
deform even in meters long axons. If the ionic transmission
is blocked between a pair of neurons, still they communicate.
Each type of ion channel has a distinct frequency band
where it opens/closes at the maximum speed (Doyle et al.,
1998; Sonnleitner and Isacoff, 2003; Demuro and Parker,
2005), a nerve impulse is not a 1D transmission of a local
point wave, rather, it is a circular vortex shape. How does
intricate time management is carried out by an axon, how do
all the ion channels in the vortex of a nerve spike move synchronously? Ghosh et al. demonstrated experimentally in the
hippocampus neuron cells (Kaech and Banker 2006; Spencer
and Kandel, 1961; Raastad and Shepherd, 2003) in 2016 that
long strings of microtubule actin and intermediate filaments
together make sure that all of them keep time (Ghosh et al.
2016a). It is utmost essential to image even the silent ions,
combining Scanning dielectric resonance microscopy, SDM
and scanning ion microscopy Ghosh et al. invented the new
microscope. Scanning dielectric resonance microscopy, SDM
was proposed in 1995 (Cho et al., 1996; Cho, 2007), that time
it was a movement to advance scanning tunneling microscope
to different directions.
Considering all the filaments are silent in the neuron
firing is unfair: The filaments dispersed in the cell fluids are
silent, but when packed in neural branches, they might vibrate
like dipoles (Sahu et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2015) could affect the
membrane potential, but no study has looked into this aspect.
If the ionic transmission is blocked between a pair of neurons,
still they communicate (Katz and Schmitt, 1940). Possibility
for two distinct communication channels electrical and ionic
is often explored in a cell as ephaptic transmission (Ramón
and Moore, 1978). Ionic and non-ionic (Jefferys, 1995) transmissions together may lead to non-synaptic firing (Dudek
et al., 1998; Ren et al., 2006), endogenous field alone causing
a firing (Qiu et al., 2015), sometimes nerve spike generates
spontaneously without any initiation (Atherton et al., 2008).
Moreover, an electromagnetic resonance is reported in the ion
channels and filaments regulating the firing. Electromagnetic
interaction of neuron: For a long period of time, extensive
research has been carried out to demonstrate that neuron
and nerve fibers not only absorb electromagnetic signal but
also radiate the electromagnetic signal, mostly in the infrared range (Fraser and Frey, 1968). When a single nerve spike
passes through, heat is produced in a nerve fiber (Howarth
et al., 1975), heat absorption and emission both take place for
a single neuron firing, such an event is named as positive and
negative heating (Abbott et al., 1958). On the other hand, by

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

applying an infrared light, one could suppress the neural activity (Duke et al., 2013), often this is called photothermal inhibition of neural activity (Yoo et al., 2014). These events happen
because the heat changes the membrane potential (Buzatu,
2009), which stops the propagation of nerve impulses through
some branches (Westerfield et al., 1978). Heat is a 5–6 THz
electromagnetic signal. Not just the membrane, it has been
shown experimentally that thermal fluctuations even causes
important changes in the filamentary dynamics located deep
inside the membrane (Gittes et al., 1993). Therefore, even the
intermediate filaments are not silent (Nixon and Shea, 1992).
Cell phone like radio-frequency fields which are primarily in
the GHz domain affects single neuron (Partsvania et al., 2013).
It has been demonstrated that radiofrequency affect the single
proteins in the animal brain (Maskey et al., 2010). Not just
proteins of ion channels, membranes and the filaments, even
electromagnetic resonance of biomaterials control feeding
and metabolism (Stanley et al., 2016). The short review is the
tiny fraction of massive research on the electromagnetic effect
on the living biomaterials and biosystems. Yet, considering
that electromagnetic effect plays no role in communication or
information processing as current neurosciences do is unfair.
A desperate need for the new technologies: Multi­
channel simultaneous resonance measurement and
A dielectric resonance scanner: Simultaneously reading the associated events unfolding at different time scales
in a nerve spike is not done yet, Ghosh et al. were the first
to build such a set up (Figure 6.9a; 2018). Just below the
microscopic image we demonstrate the schematic to explain
the task of specific electrodes. Ghosh et al. invented a tool
to characterize both filaments and ion channels at a time in
a cell, as they differ by 103 orders in time scale. One could
observe that 200–400 μs before a neural spike takes shape,
there are many simultaneous communications, one such firing is shown in Figure 6.9b and a series of them are shown
in Figure 6.9c. Cell fluid damps the mechanical resonance,
since it requires tension and physical motion but not the electromagnetic resonance that requires rearranging the dipole,
i.e., a pair of charge. Combining milliseconds response with
the nanoseconds-picoseconds one means connecting the ionic
resonance with the dipolar resonance i.e., guest and host for
ions. Since an ion channel (Harms et al., 2004) opens/close
in 10–20 nanoseconds (Tahara et al., 2015), so Ghosh et al.
invented a scanner (2018) that rapidly records (~10 ns) signal
at multiple time domains simultaneously. Only then the protein signals would be recorded at a rate of their natural vibration as the nerve impulse transmits. One of the finest eyes in
the field of neuroscience is a tool that can visualize both ionic
motion and electromagnetic signaling.
Branch failure and axonal computing: As we learn,
our brain evolves by re-wiring the neurons (Losonczy et al.,
2008), but it is still unclear, how, just by firing, the complicated paths of neural branches decide all intricate details
about the new connections to form by breaking the old ones.
­Post-1960s, the studies on the geometry of branches (Rall,
1959; Goldstein and Rall, 1974; Parnas et al., 1976; Swadlow
et al., 1980; Hines, 1989; Ofer and Shefi, 2016), how its

167

length and thickness edit the pattern of the density of ion
channels enabling a nerve impulse to stop, slow down, delay
(Manor et al., 1991), speed up, reflecting back (Baccus, 1998;
Chen et al., 2002), have made a significant stride to correlate
the topology with its information content (Debanne, 2004).
No data exist on the real-time imaging how an axon selects a
branch. Moreover, recent findings have cast a doubt whether
the density of ion channels alone regulate the axonal computing, i.e., branch failure, complex modifications of various subthreshold potentials (Scott et al., 2007; Atherton et al., 2008;
Ratte et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2012). It is not a jelly and messy
beneath the membrane, rather, the ordered architectures (Xu
et al., 2013) made of densely packed micro-neuro-filaments
(Mandelkow et al., 1991) could resonate (Sahu et al., 2013a,
2013b) as intrinsic field to modulate time (Radman et al.,
2007) to open/close the ion channel gates (Maskey et al.,
2010) and bridge the missing links between branch selection and numerous sub-threshold potentials (Duke et al., 2013;
Yoo et al., 2014). Figure 6.9d has compiled the oscillations of
various biomaterials in the neuron. The result suggests that
electromagnetic resonance covers a wide time domain.
The geometry of branches and the filaments: Axonal
computing has been one of the prime factors of information
processing studies in a neuron. When a neuron branch divides
into two, differential conduction between the two branches
is sensed accurately (Grossman et al., 1979). The difference between two branches filters noise and selects accurately the typical nature of signals required to be transported
(Stockbridge and Stockbridge, 1988). Thus, branch points
play a key role in decision-making (Stoney, 1990), at the
branch points the decisions are made (Swadlow et al., 1980),
by synchronization and de-synchronization of microtubules
and actin filaments (Zaromytidou, 2012). Axon geometry regulates the firing pattern (Ofer and Shefi, 2016); axon diameter
or caliber differs by 100 times (0.1–10 μm), thus, volume differs by 10000 times in the neural network of a human brain
(Perge et al., 2012). By varying geometry axon modulates the
frequency of transmission (Parnas et al., 1976). Geometric

ratio (Rall, 1959) GR = ddaughter
1 + ddaughter 2 dmother, works in a
perfect radial or spherical symmetry, if not symmetric it fails.
A particular neuron class holds a strict mathematical relationship, n = 3/2, however, Ghosh et al. studied 27 cases where
n = 5/3 (8), n = 8/5(19) ratios organized the time editing of
the neural pulse. Using filaments, Ghosh et al. could generate neuron firing even with a sub-threshold pulse at resonance
(Figure 6.9e), even by applying a suitable filamentary resonance signal they could switch off the firing.
Direct visualization of the branch failures: hidden circuits: One possible way to underpin how a neuron decides to
change its wiring is to image the changes in the energy density
of axonal branches, as a neuron re-wire. Selected branches
appear bright in an energy map, the rejected branches appear
dark, the visible wiring is called a circuit here. However,
all existing snapshot imaging techniques (Rivnay et al.,
2017) either chemically modify the membrane or destroy
the natural membrane signals by pumping a huge external power or make invasive contacts (Bakkum et al., 2013;

the membrane is recorded by contacting coaxial probe at Soma. (f) 5 μm deep inside a coaxial axon probe is inserted, the natural potential
fluctuation is recorded when there is no firing.

Lewandowska et al., 2015). Since the intrinsic data (Zhang
et al., 2009) is weak, interaction is faster than milliseconds,
a long integration time loses all relevant information. To see
axonal computing in a real-time, we need a wireless, intrinsic,
non-invasive, non-chemical snapshot of the whole network
with a spatial resolution <500 nm. The super-resolution does
not mean seeing the activity of channels (Schermelleh et al.,
2010). As a spike passes through the branches, both, the time
width of a pulse and the time gaps between the pulses is naturally classified. The fastest and the slowest clocks of a neuron
determines the time-sensitivity (Lundstrom et al., 2009), this
is fundamental to the development of a time crystal map of
a neuron. If one takes a snapshot of a network, for each time
domain, a distinct temporal circuit (Hutcheon and Yarom,
2000) would be visible. To visualize the coexisting circuits
as functions which have been indirectly probed for more than

half a century (Connors and Regehr, 1996), Ghosh et al. have
developed a microscope that captures multiple time-domain
snapshots at a time. “Optical nanoscopy” (Hell, 2007) that
allowed imaging below the standard diffraction limit of fluorescent light (Rust et al., 2006), including structured illumination microscopy (SIM; Betzig et al., 2006), stimulated
emission depletion (STED; Hein et al., 2008; Willig et al.,
2007), stochastic optical-reconstruction microscopy (STORM;
Rust et al., 2006), and photoactivated localization microscopy
(PALM) etc.
Highly periodic architecture deep below the neuron
membrane: Filaments did not exist for the last hundred years
(Figure 6.10a–d). Rapid-frozen, cross-section image of an
axon suggests that the central region of an axon initial segment,
AIS is filled with densely packed ordered filaments (Hirokawa,
2011; Hirokawa, et al., 1988, 1989; Chen et al., 1992;

conductivity (right). (f) STM image of a membrane captured by rupturing live neuron cell, at 2.3 V, 6 pA. Scale bar is 7 nm.

Figure 6.10c, d). The popular notion that is still out there is
that the filaments are random, float in the cellular fluid in the
AIS is incorrect. Some of these filaments like microtubule are
in parallel, unidirectional (Heidemann et al., 1981, 1984) with
a gap ~50 nm, and nearly continuous (Baas et al., 1988), in
the AIS. Highly ordered Golgi apparatus isolates the filamentbundles at the axonal or dendritic branch junctions, filamentary
continuity breaks but Golgi apparatus assists the filaments to
remain parallel inside a branch (He et al., 2016). Just below
the membrane, actin, beta-spectrin form a periodic rectangular
lattice-like structure (~200 nm cross-sectional rings of betaspectrin, connected by parallel actin wires, Xu et al., 2013)
which are found almost everywhere in the neural network, in
the glial cells and in all dendritic, axonal branches of a neural

network (D’Este et al., 2016; Gervasi et al., 2018). The ordered
architecture hosts various superstructures (D’Este et al., 2015;
Lukinavicius et al., 2014; Ganguly et al., 2015), but the ordering of guest protein molecules disappears if the microtubules in the central region of an axon is dissolved chemically
(Zhong et al., 2014). Multiple recent reports by Hirokawa
et al suggest that the network of filaments that covers 98%
by volume of an axon are closely related to the molecularly
thin periodic actin-beta-spectrin hollow cylindrical network,
which is in direct contact with the membrane above. Based
on the four findings noted above, Singh et al. (2018) build a
model structure of AIS, only to justify that Ghosh et al. built
dielectric scanner could truly measure the signals from filaments and ion channels together along with the atom probes

170

(Figures 6.10e and 6.9a). The first element is He, derived from
the long-range of filaments throughout the axon. The second
element is B, the unidirectional polarity of all filaments, third,
Hi, an equidistant (~50 nm) lattice-like arrangement of parallel filaments, fourth, Z, a periodic actin-beta-spectrin lattice
coupled to the filamentary core. Singh et al. theoretically generates a dielectric slab-based model HeBHiZ of an AIS and
experimentally verify that the system vibrates as a single dipolar unit at THz-GHz frequencies related to its geometric shape,
consequently, builds the MHz periodic oscillations to assist the
membrane’s kHz ionic spikes. These are some of the reasons,
that led researchers to think, it is microtubule that is carrying
out information processing in the neuron (Dent et al., 2014).
Ghosh et al. (2016a) imaged the single ion channels to crosscheck live if an ion channel bursts by wireless communication
(Figure 6.10f). These intrinsic structures build temporal coding
(Magee, 2003).

6.7.1 Triplet of Triplet Resonance Band
in the Axon of a Neuron
Figure 6.9d plot shows that the resonance frequencies are
isolated and discrete bands for neural components. That’s an
incomplete picture. Figure 6.11a–c suggests that all the clocks
are nested just like a time crystal as shown for microtubule
in Figure 6.4a, b. The AC signal applied parallel to the axon
triggers AIS only at three distinct frequency ranges, where a
short pulse (pulse width 1 µs, total duration 1 ms) from the
Patch-clamp at a sub-threshold bias (~20–30 mV) activates
the firing (Spencer and Kandel, 1961). An additional vertical
AC signal resolves each of those three frequency domains into
three additional sets; Sahu et al. observed nine bands. Inserting
two probes into the axon when one measures the resonance
bands across the AIS, only three resonance bands are observed
in the linear plot (Figure 6.11d, e). An ordered biological structure exhibits a major longitudinal and a transverse vibration
mode (Pokorny et al., 1997; Daneshmand and Amabili, 2012);
if the AC signal is applied in one direction, only one mode is
probed. Resonating with both horizontal and transverse vibrations at different combinations of horizontal and vertical AC
signals also reveals additional peaks inside the nine bands
(Figure 6.12a–c). Therefore, the relative angular orientations
of the three smaller circles vary by 100°–120° in each of the
three larger circles, but they unravel an additional dynamic hidden in the nine bands. 3D resonance map of a neuron unravels
three distinct time domains or clocks that regulate the nerve
impulse.
As electrical nerve impulse forms at AIS, Ghosh et al.
measured a collective resonance of the AIS connected axon
core. The resonance behavior of axons with and without
membrane in a single neuron was reported (Ghosh et al.,
2016a, Agrawal et al., 2016c). Consistency of triplet of triplet band with and without membrane prompts us to get inside
a single microtubule that constitutes the major part of an
axon. The microfilament bundle located deep inside the
membrane are responsible for the higher-level communication, even if ion flow is blocked between a pair of neurons,

Nanobrain

purely electrical connections run (Katz and Schmitt, 1940).
Endogenous fields have been measured by inserting a coaxial atomic sharp probe deep inside an axon (Ghosh et al.,
2016a). However, the debate related to the internal fields of
an axon is in the mainstream neuroscience for a long time
(Radman et al., 2009).
The resonance behavior of a single isolated microtubule is
reported by Sahu et al., but not its 2D resonance pattern with
gating. They dropped freshly reconstituted microtubule solution on the electrode grid, and an AC frequency scan is carried out similar to the neuron study. Ghosh et al. measured the
intensity of the transmitted signal along microtubule length
as a function of two perpendicularly applied AC signals
across the microtubule. Similar to the neuron, the microtubule exhibits a triplet-triplet resonance band, but it is electromagnetic, not ionic. Additional transverse field along with the
horizontal AC pumping (using two perpendicular electrodes)
changes the angular positions of the circles, but their relative areas remain constant. As a result, if one superimposes
neuron’s and microtubule’s triplet-triplet bands, should notice
shifts but the common frequency/time regions never disappear. It suggests that the clocks of isolated microtubule and
AIS are coupled.

6.7.2 Scale-Free Triplet of Triplet Band in
Tubulin, Microtubule, and Neuron
Linguistic form of the fundamental unit of information:
The basic philosophy to computing without using the algorithm is to let the pattern of primes to integrate the symmetry
of events. The new type of computing is inspired by the discovery of primes in the protein vibrations. The distribution
of resonance frequencies in the tubulin protein, microtubule
and neuron were following a similar group of primes. As if
they were designed to clock “time” differed by the ratio of
preferred primes. Three-layered studies between tubulin,
microtubule and neuron inspired us to extrapolate the idea of
integrating the resonance peaks as the ratio of primes which
signifies that any event in the universe is made of three layers of sub-events. The slowest clock is the host or subject, the
present clock within the slowest clock is the key or clause or
condition at which an event occurs, the fastest clock within
the present clock is how an event occurs or a verb along with
the clock representing the quality of an event or adjective.
The linguistic key, event = [subject-clause-(verb-adjective)] is
the basic data structure to reverse engineer nature’s information processing.
In summary, Reddy et al. generalized the concept of
using the ratio of primes by the proteins as the PPM; clocking a set of resonance peaks one inside another into the
GML and the engineering of microtubule into a new kind
of fourth-circuit element, functionally a tubule-morphic
device that implements the PPM and the GML. Thus, three
basic concepts define frequency fractal computing. Primes
produce integers as a product, the event multiplication gives
birth to changing geometric shape, so runs the computing
universe.

membrane (bottom); scale bar is ~10 µm for both. To their right the corresponding transmission spectrum, showing electromagnetic resonance. The triplet of triplet bands are shaded.

Ghosh et al. cultured a pair of rat hippocampal neurons
on a pre-grown electrode array (Figure 6.12a). The growth
was monitored so that the neural branches did not touch any
electrode, using atom probes and dc fields one can regulate
branching. Prior to any resonance measurement (Sahu et al.,
2013b), a pair of patch-clamp probes were placed, rupturing
the soma membrane in one/two neighboring neurons to measure the potential difference between them. The potential of
a nerve impulse with respect to the culture solution is consistent with reported values. On the chip, the ac electromagnetic signals were applied via a pair of electrodes (PQ and
RS; Figure 6.12a) along the axon horizontally, as if dendritic
branches are the sources of a signal and axonal branches are
the drains. Perpendicular to it using MN electrode gating
signal is applied to regulate the nerve impulse. PQ and RS
electrodes change frequencies synchronously. Keeping the
perpendicularly applied ac signal of MN fixed at a particular
frequency Ghosh et al. changed the frequency of the ac signal

applied along the axon length via PQ and RS. Then changed
the transverse ac signal frequency via MN and repeated the
frequency scan via PQ and RS. Thus, a 2D input frequency
pattern is generated not just in a neuron, but in all the proteins studied following this protocol. The basic electronic
set up used to measure and filter the resonance frequency is
described in multiple carbon nanotube measurements.
On the 3D pattern of Figure 6.12, at particular pairs of
horizontal and vertical ac frequencies, the neuron generates a
potential for nerve impulse and releases ions (<1% of threshold
firing current, ~50 nA; i.e., ~100 pA), even at the sub-threshold biases of 20–30 mV. The potential makes the vertical axis;
hence, a 3D resonance frequency map is generated for the
neuron. A 3D plot for the normalized firing potential (vertical axis) as a function of two perpendicular ac frequencies
applied across the neuron, shows nine hills with circular
bases. The map is unique because, the horizontal plane mapping the frequencies is the electromagnetic resonance and the

ON across EF and GH, respectively, independently. Horizontally to the right of panel a, b and c, the three Log-log scale plots of resonance
frequency corresponding to the three experimental setups are given. For the panel a, the patch-clamp measured current difference between
neuron 1 Soma and neuron 2 Soma is the vertical axis Imax = 10 nA, Imin = 1 pA; two horizontal axes, one along the length (L = 50 Hz
to 2.5 kHz, 2.5–250 kHz and 1–30 MHz) and the other along the width W. Wherein, W = LX0.3, if L = 1 Hz, then 0.3–1.3 Hz variation is
made along the vertical axis, thus the vertical axis is linear frequency width, its upper and lower limits are percentage values Wmin = −30,
Wmax = +30 for all panels a, b and c. For panel b and c, the 3D resonance plot’s vertical axis is relative ac power transmission (P output/P
input = P (0 < P < 1)) across horizontal XY and EF electrode pairs respectively. Horizontal axes are frequency for all three panels. For panel
a, the length, width and vertical ranges are noted above, for panel b ranges are (triplet band) 10–300 kHz, 10–230 MHz and 1–20 GHz, and
for panel c ranges are (triplet band) 30–450 MHz, 1–250 GHz and 20–350 THz. To the right of all three 3D plots we show the corresponding
vertical visuals, panel a is zoomed.

vertical axis is intrinsic resonance causing the nerve impulse.
In the resonance frequency pattern, three bright circles represent the situation when a neuron positively gated by horizontal
electrodes while the low intensity part shows that horizontal electrode system is arresting the nerve spikes. One could
notice that three prime resonance frequency domains host
three further resonance frequency domains inside making the
triplet of triplet frequency band. Doublet and triplet of resonance frequencies is a common observation atomic orbital
resonance of molecules, a similar kind of resonance behavior
is observed here.
An essential component of a single microtubule is a tubulin protein dimer. Tubulin protein solution was dropped in the
gap of a four-probe electrode array, then a DC bias was applied
to order 15–20 molecules. For 8–100 tubulins, the resonance

band remained independent of the number of molecules or the
electrode geometry. Similar to the microtubule and neuron
cell, a triplet of triplet resonance band was observed. The axon
core, microtubule and tubulin have self-similar bands, with a
common frequency region,—a similar structural symmetry
governs the resonance in all the three systems. Helical distribution of neural branches, rings of proteins in the axonal
core, spirals of proteins in the microtubule, α helices in the
proteins, are the common structures, and the resonant energy
transmission in generic spiral symmetry follows a quantized
behavior (Sahu et al., US patent 9019685B2). Hence, a spiral
symmetry possibly ensures coupling of all the clocks.
For all the three systems, neuron, microtubule and tubulin,
each of the nine circles in the triplet-triplet band has 6–8 small
circles inside (Figure 6.12). Since proteins are basic structures,

Unprecedented Technologies found in Nature Led by Harvesting the Geometry of Singularity

they are pumped with the same resonating electromagnetic
signal and simultaneously imaged. The resonant oscillations image of a tubulin dimer show only two high potential
regions, not eight (online Movies in Ref Sahu et al., 2015),
so, dimers are not responsible for 6–8 small circles. Scanning
the isolated tubulin monomer using the tunneling microscope
at various resonance frequencies showed four major and four
minor distinct potential regions inside the monomer exchange
energy. Total eight for a dimer. Protein dimer makes a doublet
but monomer makes an octave. The one to one correspondence with the dielectric resonance image suggests that the
observed 6–8 peaks in one of the 9 circles of tubulin are from
α- helices localized by the β sheets. Thus, 106 orders of a spatial journey from micro to the nanoscale execute milliseconds
to sub-nanoseconds clocks. En route, the GHz clock that fires
a neuron originates at the single protein structure.
The triplet-triplet resonant band is not exclusive to
microtubules and tubulins. Ghosh et al. have selected
mostly found four components in the axon core, and around
AIS and similarly measured their temporal resonance map
(Leterrier et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2013). It was observed that
actin microfilament’s resonance bands are complementary to
that of the microtubule,—they exchange energy covering a
wide frequency domain. The resonance bands for all four proteins β-spectrin, ankyrin, actin and tubulin,—also their complexes are confined between the two frequency limits;—they
share the time zone of threshold energy bursts. Overlapping
time zone in the resonance frequency plot is common energy
exchange regions for proteins. Thus, resonance chain forms.
The β-spectrin structure has ion-transfer channels and
ankyrin a known mechanosensor (Lee et al., 2006) have a
cascade of α-helix oscillators dominating their resonance
band. Hence, they exhibit a topological hysteresis in the 2D
resonance spectrum measured by Ghosh et al. Moreover,
β-spectrin and ankyrin show signatures of their lone cavities
in the resonance band as doublets. A doublet in the 2D resonance pattern means the two clocks governing its resonance
are coupled as part of one clock. There are plenty of other proteins that participate in generating the nerve spike. The current map is a fraction to the varieties of proteins available out
there. However, the NMR like doublets and triplets in various
compositions suggest that the resonance chain would exhibit
much richer topology, once more proteins are added to it.
A musical wheel of a triplet of triplet frequencies:
Conventional 1D resonance plot is a single line on the 3D resonance frequency map which is represented as a triplet of triplet circles. Triplet of triplet is not an absolute pattern, one could
see pentate or even doublets, frequency fractal or resonance
chain’s topology is not as simple as reported earlier (Buzsáki,
2005b). The frequency wheel is created by the common time
zones shared by the overlapping resonance frequencies of four
proteins and their complexes studied here. Sonification of this
frequency wheel reveals how vibrating discrete-time clocks
topologically integrate into a single neuron firing. The higher
frequencies are the patterns of protein’s oscillations, while the
slower frequencies represent protein complexes with larger
structures. A complete rotation of the wheel are events that

173

unfold from faster to the slower time scales to eventually trigger a single nerve spike. Until now, the rapid firing of a neuron
was sonified as a stream of “ticks,” here one “tick” of a nerve
impulse is deconstructed with 72 frequencies bursting signals
in an intricate pattern (Figure 6.4b).

6.8 THE MEASUREMENT OF A COMPLETE
TIME CRYSTAL MAP OF A NEURON
How nature processes GHz data or THz data or pHz data?
Do not read but match 15 patterns at all time scales simultaneously! To detect a time crystal, one requires technology
to simultaneously measure multiple time domains, as shown
in Figure 6.13a. At the rate of GHz, a material generates 109
bits of data per second. Then for THz, 1012 bits of data is captured per second. The memory drives fill up faster than one
could imagine, analog data should be converted into a digital
one at that very rate. How to manage them? Furthermore, one
has to adjust the speeds of data transfer at all time scales so
that we find a generic geometric relationship between them.
One should do just the opposite, follow what the human brain
does. Instead of searching bits of information, directly search
for the fifteen basic geometric shapes, i.e., phase relationship that gets locked between different signals. For example,
human memory strength is estimated by theta-frequency
phase-locking of single neurons (Rutishauser et al., 2010).
Proactive search for a dodecahedron in the big data, the 12
planes may be shifted but would deliver an insight. Therefore,
modify the search topology and find how the corners of the
geometric shapes would shift. It is so nice to say that we will
take a topology and start building higher level geometries on
this topology. But doing it in reality is extremely difficult. If
we do not know the skeleton of the information architecture
of the universe, we cannot glue the shapes. The pattern of
primes connected to geometric language do just that. Similar
to astrophysics, a metric that links change in the symmetry,
runs a feedforward loop and correct the information structure
of a system, here it is time crystal map of a neuron.
Time crystals obtained at the femtoseconds and at the
pico-seconds time scales is the new neuron code (Perkell and
Bullock, 1968), are perturbed to find how imaginary worlds
are linked, it sets the prescription for a multi-nion tensor.
Since here in this book we are confining ourselves within the
domain of 11D dynamics, to find the universal time crystal
the hardware would store the stream of local time crystals
for a long time until higher level clocks integrate them. If
we cross beyond 11 layers we do not search anymore for a
dodecanion. We might need to make detailing of some of the
patterns we see for hours (micro-hertz), then we can look into
some of its important topology in the second’s scale, it zooms
and finds some interesting topology at the microseconds
scale, then finds some more. Rapid neural data recording is
already there (Gong et al., 2015), locking phase is observed as
all frequencies (Hoppensteadt and Keener, 1982), phase locking is studied statistically (Hurtado et al., 2004). The journey through time scale for the human brain goes on and on
to the femtoseconds. But who decides the interest? It is done

FIGURE 6.13 (a) Simultaneous reading of 12 channels of a neuron from 12 electrodes. Each channel reads a few parts of the whole time
crystal which are shown at the top of each channel reading. The brightness is the intensity of the signals, the frequency of the signal is normalized to one and converted into the time domain. From the pattern the corresponding time crystal is generated. (b) 360° rotation of the

by two factors. First one is memory and the second one is
PPM that contains the map of all possible uncertainties. Be it
the conventional electronics hardware, or brain jelly, reading
“bits” is replaced by “topology search.” Do not see all the
data, because it is impossible, but inspired by the universal
links between topologies we get into building a multi-timescale topology of our own. Who knows we may be doing just
that at this moment in our brain now? At least neuron is doing
so (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000).
The challenges are plenty to build a frequency map of a
neuron, neurons use phase change and frequency change at a
time (Hastings et al., 1985; Hess and Boiteux, 1971). 104 spatial scale journey means carriers change in their nature of the
response to signals, so we need different tools. Ions resonate
in the milliseconds time domain, large dipoles in microseconds, small dipoles in nanoseconds, atomic bonds in picoseconds. A biomaterial is like an observer who sees only the
minutes spike in a day-to-day used watch, not that of a second
or an hour. Therein, the topology of time is a circle. Every
pixel on the circle’s perimeter is a circle, even if that circle is
zoomed, we see pixels turn to a circle (Figure 6.13a, right).
So, the tools to see a smaller distance shows more objects side
by side, but for time, to see more, one needs a topology to
see within a given time. For two centuries spatial map had no
such problem. Here we unravel the basic topology of neuron

clocks to begin the quest to map time architecture of a neuron (Strumwasser, 1974). Its long argued that cell cycles are
nested clocks (Shields, 1976; Smith and Martin, 1973).
For half a century, neurophysiology had only one tool
patch-clamp to study the neural response in milliseconds. No
technology existed to see what happens during a ~1 ms firing
at multiple faster time scales simultaneously. Now, an array
of coaxial atom probes maps highly active time zones during the span of a neuron firing from microseconds to picoseconds by reading all clocks from a single protein scale to
the neural membrane simultaneously. Reading many clocks
at once requires a new generation of machines. All the probes
recording their distinct time scale events should be part of
an independent measuring system in the hardware. Recording
by all probes should be synchronized using a global master
clock, only then one could find the integrated 3D geometric
information of the material (Figure 6.13b).
Final challenge is to slow down the transmission or
edit it like a transistor gate to operate below their resonance threshold. Carefully opening the transistor gate
in 1952 triggered a computer revolution, here gating the
signal transmission line for neurons at ~100 μm to a
protein ~2 nm requires nano-lithography for the microwave engineering of communication ports. Ceasing the
nerve impulse through an axon, electrical and magnetic

transmission through the microtubule surface and finally
through a group of single protein molecules require a
nanoscale control of biomaterials movement using dielectrophoresis. If water layer is more than ~5–10 nm around
biomaterials, ions transmit ~10 −6A, resonate at ~1 nW.
The 10 −12A current and 10 −18 W of resonant signals of biomaterials are totally masked. After all precautions, when
one plots the frequency or time response, irrespective of

size or the origin of resonance, be it ionic in the membrane
and orbital coupling in a single protein, only then the
pattern of clocks becomes evident (Figure 6.14). Gating
in a transistor is done by vertically applying an arresting potential across the horizontal source and the drain.
The same process was repeated here for a neuron, an axon,
a microtubule and a single tubulin protein (Figure 6.12).

Non-dual Shaivism of Kashmir (Trika)
It is the sensory misperception that leads us to believe that our consciousness is locally confined to this world; that’s
why time to time an opposite thought (non-local) arises in our mind and that elevates us to a higher-level consciousness.

2.1 INCOMPLETENESS OF CURRENT
INFORMATION THEORY
Is it better to see a triangle or read 100001010101010000000?
These sets of letters make no sense to us. We need a decoder
to read it. What if we have a language that has a decoder, our
perception, a higher-level argument? For centuries, information was an inanimate object. Imagine a time in the future
when information is like a life form. It has a clock to keep
time and a geometric relation as its significance or importance; it could be understood as a cognitive entity, with no
reality or classical physical existence; it is like a concept. If
we indeed find the information structure of the universe or
our brain, we should be able to understand it as soon as we
look at the information structure. Seeing a geometry, we must
say, is a structure of fear or a structure of a joy.
When everybody bypasses undefined and s­ingularity,
here is a creature that cannot survive without them: If
somehow, we preserve the way the events are linked in nature,
we do not have to create scientific models or theories; the pattern that links is itself the scientific theory. Writing an equation may not be the only way to practicing science; it could
be singing too. Unfortunately, connecting the events within
and above was always considered scientifically impossible,
and undefined, and if one could not make equations or differentiation, then what would be the point of studying these
events? So, historically, scientists have always found a way
to bypass such singularity. What if nature’s journey is only
through singularity? While traversing an infinite path within
and above, nature might consider that every single event that
has happened, happening, and will happen are all linked by
a topology. One at a time, a sensor sees only one event as a
single point, but there is an endless journey within and above.
A new generation of sensors is required that could read to
find that discrete, isolated events are not random and that they
are linked by a topology; but that linking, even if regulated

by free will, would not be random. If the universe is cooked
using finite geometric elements, then it has a defined pattern
made of undefined points. Free will is random only when we
want to confine it in a linear sequence. However, if we want
to see events as a topology growing within and above, finite
events could be arranged following a finite number of choices
in mathematics. Computing or decision-making is always
about linking events: the choices of combining events make
a pattern, and that pattern is universal. If a system or computer has an imaginary hardware that links events following
that pattern, admittedly, it would be able to predict the future
without depending on human imagination–driven scientific
models or learning algorithms. That is the idea of making
an artificial brain, and all artificial brains have an embedded
event-linking pattern hardware, so when they interact with the
events unfolding in nature, both arrange the events similarly,
plan events similarly, and execute events similarly. Turing’s
culture to melt and rebuild is replaced by “be like it”—that is
the new bit.
Connecting the dots: “It from bit,” to continuous to
geometric: Every single knowledge that science generates
is asking a question by doing an experiment, whose answer
would be in terms of “yes or no”; thus, we derive “it from
bit” (Wheeler, 1990). “Every ‘it’—derives its function, its
meaning, its very existence entirely—even if in some contexts indirectly—from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes
or no questions, binary choices, bits” (Tukey, 1984). Nature
arranges events “bit by bit,” linearly, and we read only one
reply at a time. There are plenty of problems with this philosophy (Figure 2.1): (a) A directly opposite thesis could
be that the physics at the bottom is continuous; nature does
not write information as a bit, does not connect events linearly. (b) Nature could write events as vibrating strings, like
string theory. There could be unknown grand unification
theory, suggesting a unique event for physics at the bottom.
(c) The local environment might change the response when

we ask a question to a single entity. “The choice of a question
asked, and choice of when it is asked, play a part—not the
whole part, but a part—in deciding what we have the right
to say” (Wheeler, 1984, 1986). Who, what, when, and how
are four questions that structure a bit at the bottom. (d) A bit
could be an expression of many, indistinguishable, entities.
If the physics at the bottom is topological, then events are
­connected by phase; a qudit can model such physics at the
bottom. However, if every single event in the universe is made
of a topology of subevents, then neither classical nor quantum mechanics could act reasonably. The information is not a
language of bits, but a geometry of silence. (d) Always, there
is a question, information of whom? If there is no answer as
to whom, the rest is human imagination, and we build physics models as an extension of a black box. (e) Connecting the
bits to regenerate a natural phenomenon includes a human
bias. Probability, like space and time, is invented by humans,
and different people have a different belief; they connect the
bits or dots differently to produce the same output, assess the
future differently. Probability as frequency, per Bayes theorem (Jaynes, 1986; Denning, 1989), is a function of human

belief (Berger and Berry, 1988), agreed upon by a large number of people (Burke, 1985); thus integrated information
theory (IIT) accounts for the political strength of a human
belief. Despite their great explanatory power, physics laws do
not describe reality; they lie (Cartwright, 1983). The reason
for non-reality is the scientific method (Feyerabend, 1975).
Define what understanding is: Define whose information, and who measures: The structure of science is loaded
with human bias and a luck factor that, if interacting with the
right entity, would address the question we ask (Figure 2.1,
see human bias). The scientific endeavor to understand the
existence of life or that of the universe is a trial and error to
ask the right question at the right time, to a right entity, and in
the right way. Understanding is not universal. “Meaning is the
joint product of all the evidence that is available to those who
communicate” (Follesdal, 1975). We need an information
theory that addresses the silence or even non-communication.
Thus far, we have no structure, no plan of organization, no
framework of ideas underlaid by another structure or level
of ideas, underlaid by yet another level, by yet another, ad

is not mandatory to have a grand unification theory, to have
such an architecture of information. To endlessness no alternative is evident but a loop (Wheeler, 1988), and such a loop
as this: Physics gives rise to observer-participancy (Wheeler,
1977), observer-participancy gives rise to information, and
information gives rise to physics. Quantum interactions tell
us that it is possible to do measurement without changing the
state. In that sense, a new information theory should inspire
from the Ahranov-Bohm experiment (Aharonov and Bohm,
1959) where that flux of magnetic lines of force finds itself
embraced between—but untouched by—the two-electron
beams that fan out from the two slits. The shift in the interference fringes between field off and field on reveals the magnitude of the flux:

Phase change around the perimeter of the included area
 shift of the interference pattern, 
= 2 vr × 

 measured in several fringes

= ( electron charge ) × ( magnetic flux embraced ) / c

Even quantum experiments that avoid collapse as they
are “untouched by electron beam” and gather “it from
bit.” Even quantum experiments consider that truth about
nature could reveal as a “yes” or “no” answer to the query
(Wheeler, 1984).
The answer to “yes” or “no” is not the only way to learn
the truth; not bit-by-bit but within-and-above, singularity in geometric phase: We ­suggest that there could be an
experiment where we do not need to ask questions. We built
a series of technologies with simple instrumentation to sense
pure information from a system. Quantum provides the trick
to measure the change in phase, a non-­demolition way of measuring an event.
The universe is not just participatory; both the observer
and the environment are part of information content. Thus,
the information is geometric. All Wheeler’s criteria are fulfilled, except for the following:
1. Information is an infinite network of geometric
shapes.
2. Observer and environment effects are neutralized as an infinite conformal network is created
3. Time and space are both tools to measure
interval: the phase is a continuum, and we create interval looking into the location of singularities on the loop perimeter. Thus, mass, time,
and length disappear; we intricately map the
singularities.
4. Geometric shapes are made of singularity points.
Events are not real; there is no classical point in
the network of events.
5. Geometric phase is not continuous, as believed
in the classic version of quantum mechanics
(Anandan, 1988; Anandan and Aharonov, 1988).

All solids we see are dead and empty by science, and that is
a fact: Mathematically several researchers argue for a fractal
world, and possibly that is why nature is proposed as a computer (Margolus, 2003). There are plenty of rhythms far outside our body, and there is plenty of rhythm deep inside our
body. Both kinds of rhythms run beyond our senses. Beyond
our senses, the rhythms run, we perceive those only when they
affect the rhythms of our conscious experience. Therefore, for
Turing’s world, the universe is melted and rebuilt as an infinitely long thread whose pixels are binary bits; for the universe we explore here in this book, the entire universe is an
intricately connected 3D geometric shape whose only reality
is the bursts from the singularity points, and rhythms bridge
the gap between the singularity points. Zillions of system
points touch the corners of the geometric shapes, and its periodic motions are seen as running clocks. The universe is lifelike and cannot be melted and rebuilt; we need a probe that
has a similar architecture in order to learn about it, and that is
the artificial brain explored here.
No event in nature could be re-created by arranging a set of
elementary events one after another. An event could itself be
a closed 3D topological structure. Imagine a cube: each of its
eight points is a subevent, so, when we linearize, we destroy
coexisting paths linking the subevents. If nature integrates
subevents as topology, the journey to integrate information
would be within and above, never side by side. If we could
reduce Big Data into a topology, once we convert, then we
apply pure physics: how topological structures change, break
symmetry, and undergo a phase transition. So, without finding a programmer to unravel ideas in dead “bits,” we can use
physicists to predict threats or other decision-making. Then
decision-making is possible without writing a single line of
an algorithm, just like our brain does it always. Geometric
entities could be used for computation, and the idea is not new
(Forrest, 1971; Preparata and Shamos, 1985); but the use of
geometric shapes as a composition to build up mathematical
constructs was not yet there.
Simple analogies to understand a time crystal: Space
singularity creates a spatial crystal, and the phase singularity
creates a time crystal. Time crystal does not have time within,
by closing a loop it defines a unit of time. Imagine many such
clocks are arranged in a 3D space; one could build infinite
close pathways by connecting the clocks. The topology of
time cycles is different; therein, we cannot add the time linearly. Time is not a flow of the wave, and it is a cycle, a closed
loop. One has to wait for the singularity bursts to sense that
a circle has completed a rotation. Only then we can estimate
the phase structure. That is why we sense the phase singularity points and note the geometry they reveal. A good analogy
is an electron rotating around a complex orbit, on the phase
sphere always there is a circular orbit, but that orbit rotates
with a phase velocity. If the phase change makes a sudden
jump and an energy packet emits only then we get the information about a phase change, else if there is an orbital jump
we get different information. Orbital transition is not our target, for detecting a time crystal we wait when the rotation of
an orbit reaches a singularity and makes a jump, the energy

28

emits naturally. So, a time crystal is not about the clocking of
an electron, a symmetry breaking or phase transition when
an electron jumps from one orbit to another, it is exclusively a
topology of phase singularity on the sphere only. Take another
analogy. Several car drivers running cars, all of their minds
are connected, for a time crystal we are not interested in the
time required to travel, the path being traversed, but sudden
maneuver to avoid accidents is visible which accounts for the
interconnected state of the minds of all drivers. That sudden event is analogous to burst from a singularity and thus,
reflects some features about the topology in the mind of the
drivers. That static architecture of phase singularities is the
time crystal, an engine that bursts at the singularity.
Particles move clocks run, Clocks interact singularities
burst, Phase of bursts jumps in architecture, those jumps build
time crystal. The photon moves like a particle; it is not time; it
does not keep time; it is not a time crystal. However, if several
photons interact, all clocks would run, change each other, that
is not time crystal. However, when interacting clocks jump
in phase, they reveal singularities. Only a time crystal reads
another time crystal. Since there is no signal propagation, it is
all about a match between two-time crystal releasing coherent
bursts and clocking signals from singularity points. Reading
one singularity points one by one not possible.

2.1.1 Fractal Tape and Surgery of a 2D
Image to Place It in a Nested Sphere
All journey begins from a tape: Universality is nothing but a
statement written in a piece of paper that can be solved without taking outside help. If we write statements line by line
on a piece of paper and after cutting those parts, we can glue
them in a line exactly as we said above, this is universality,
this is complete (Gödel’s completeness theorem; Gödel, 1938,
1947). However, we can imagine millions of different ways
so that we need some arguments not written in that piece of
paper. Figure 2.2a shows one such way. In biological systems,
there are multiple clocks one inside another and all are triggered simultaneously, we do not know why biological systems do that? All fractal Turing tapes proposed till date are
Iterative Function System (IFS) class as shown in Figure 2.2a,
which means a particular seed geometry is repeated in a 2D
or 3D space. One can see the entire fractal shape like a fractal antenna, nothing lies in the imaginary space. Such systems were introduced to compute at a “nearly linear time”
(Gurevich and Shelah, 1989). Only when we enter in a cell,
we find another tape as shown in Figure 2.2a (Ghosh et al.,
2014a). In principle this is an infinite network, each tape is
incomplete. For a particular tape, all other tapes are in the
imaginary space and time. We simply cannot define a state
as is, every single element is a door to another universe inside
and it is a constituent of another universe, including the
observer, and the journey is endless. In mathematical terms,
we say every single matter is an “escape point,” building
escape time fractal, ES tape. One could argue that why should
one care about the imaginary tag, have two Turing tapes, one
for real-world data and the other for the imaginary world.

Nanobrain

Together, two tapes process the entire information in parallel,
then even quantum computer is a Turing machine. Though
we start with a Turing tape, since (i) not a single cell in entire
tape network is complete, (ii) no part of tape network cannot
be cut into isolated tapes, (iii) we cannot take derivative at any
cell space, therefore, it is not a Turing tape network anymore.
Inventing a fractal tape that does not have a Turing
analog: In the Turing vision of the universe, one could melt
and everything out there as a long 1D chain of bits. It would
be a complete description. The concept of fractal tapes as
shown in Figure 2.2a right, was proposed to run many Turing
tapes side-by-side like a tree or in any self-similar or fractal
geometry (Pippinger and Fischer, 1979). The advantages of
geometric shapes in decision-making were explored in details
in the 1990s. There are a series of pioneering works to keep
time nearly linear using various geometric arrangements of
Turing tapes (Gurevich and Shelah, 1989). Every single cell
in a Turing tape is defined. Since we redefine any event happening in the universe as a clocking geometric shape, whose
corner points are sub-events, an architecture of the clocks
is important. To build that architecture, we need a defined
machine, to eventually replace the Turing tape. The new
tape we call Fractal tape, the name is an oxymoron, because
there is nothing fractal about it, except that researchers and
general readers, all consider that if there is a set of objects
inside an object in an infinite network that is a fractal, we call
it Mandelbrot attraction. We get a Fractal tape by placing a
Turing tape in every single cell of a host Turing tape (Ghosh
et al., 2014a; Agrawal et al., 2016b), so, every single cell is
undefined in the infinite tape network. Since undefined, one
cannot build a differential equation. The result is the development of multiple technologies, which are junk in conventional
electronics, and making several nonsense and irrelevant computing concepts useful.
The discovery of time crystal and remarkable effort for
two decades (1970–1990): We all know that a crystal is made
of matter, but how could it be made of time? It was the genius
of Winfree A., who made two striking observations (Winfree,
1977). He noted that a random noise could not change the
biological clocks arbitrarily, the perturbation should be particular. Only at a particular phase of the clock, if the perturbation sustains for a long time, only then the output phase
changes significantly. However, once a system is perturbed,
even after removing the source of perturbation, three spontaneously emerging frequency peaks emerge in the output
ripple, not one. In between 1970 and 1990 for two decades, a
wide range of living biological samples showed these incredible features. In summary, (i) biological clocks have a hidden structure of phase singularities, (ii) the mechanics of this
structure of clocks are undefined, neither classical nor quantum. Both the mechanics do not have any provision for triggering a chain of events in the absence of a perturbation or a
noise. (iii) The hidden architecture of clocks is designed to
operate with noise as a perturbation and no random noise can
edit or even manipulate that structure. By conditioning when,
how, and which noise could interact, a biological system uses
noise as an intelligent and programmed signal source.

a geometric shape (bottom-right). (c) The top row shows decomposition of a pentagon. Corner points are singularities. Each point holds a
geometric shape inside. The bottom row shows the corresponding time crystals.

Engineering the Bloch sphere: Brain is neither a classical
nor a quantum computer because it does not have a defined
classical state; it is not even a computer. Quantum can survive
with an infinite number of real solutions (Unruh and Zurek,
1989), but we do not need a single real state, but 12 imaginary
worlds affecting the reality. Probability, like time, is a concept invented by humans, and human observation that decides
when and where to measure finds unique solutions accordingly (Wheeler, 1990). So, we need to add an observer to the
wave function (Wheeler, 1977), and the environment too.
These are not possible if there is a classical point on the Bloch
sphere. We need a Bloch sphere, a sphere with infinite solutions between two choices. However, instead of impure classical (Joos and Zeh, 1985), it should be made of singularity
points, paving the way for an observer, environment and geometric shape to be part of the fundamental unit of information

of the universe. We need quantum for using the beautiful concept of Bloch sphere, modify it by adding a clock on its great
circle to build a suitable unit of information for the universe
(Wheeler, 1983b). The Bloch sphere does not have a singularity, here for the new unit of information, and it is all about
opening/closing multiple holes or singularities on the Bloch
sphere, as shown in Figure 2.2b. Then time as a 3D geometric structure made of the phase of a set of vibrating material,
so we may think, the matter is real, the phase of vibration is
imaginary, dependent on the matter but it is not valid. When a
pair of clocking spheres synchronize, the phase difference of
these vibrating clocks gives the concept of time, when several
clocking spheres couple to bond, they fill up a region of timedomain wherein it does not allow other phase structures to
occupy, it is just the concept of space. Thus, a phase structure
could govern a physical space, so neither space is fundamental

30

nor the time is, it is a phase. As Einstein said, “Time and space
are modes by which we think and not conditions in which we
live.” (Einstein, 1963).
Six fundamental changes to be made in defining what
is an event in nature: (1) Nature store event in a geometric
shape, if we do not change the sensors and capture the geometric structure of the events in the pure form, once destroyed,
human imagination using deep learning cannot rebuild the
accurate information ever. Time crystal analyzer should capture natural events as nested clocks to build a generic time
crystal. (2) Existing science and the foundation of artificial
intelligence tells us that whatever be the complexity of events,
we can re-build that event as a sequence of simple events. It is
not right. Nature store events not “side by side,” instead, “one
inside another.” Thus, not just how the event looks like, the
geometric arrangement of several events happens one inside
another, which again needs to be captured at the sensor level,
which we do. (3) All events are new and original is an illusion. Events continuously repeat until it encounters a new
symmetry. Finite clocks arranged in a few symmetries one
88
inside another could project in 360° spherical direction 8
ways (8 = number of singularities). Infinite possibilities could
generate from finite elements if the singularity is explored.
Symmetry is finite, but their corresponding geometric shapes
could be infinite. (4) Nature integrates events using all possible symmetries and all possible choices, we discovered this
metric in the protein, and using this metric, we crosscheck the
geometric structure of events. The fine-tuning enables getting
rid of human bias, fix errors in reading events as time crystal
and predicting the future by adding time crystals following
phase prime metric (PPM), so everything is done naturally
without programming. (5) The number of bits, amount of
resources, speed, all these are irrelevant, a trillion-switch,
holding a single symmetry could represent only one clock or
one symmetry. When at all layers, all the clocks operate at
various speeds, continually update geometric changes in big
data, there is no computing time or computing speed. Zillions
of data can pass through, and the system checks whether the
geometry of clocks change or remains constant with minor
editing. (6) It was never thought that even devices with no
connections in between could link by the time building a circuit of time. Superlensing ability (Figure 9.4b) isolates the
connected devices, gives one device in a complex mixture a
distinction, thus allows building a singular clock using distant
elements. A device is visible only when it wants to be seen.
A device with a set of cloaking frequencies could form multiple distinct circuits, with far distant located elements. Imagine
an entire living system is a circuit of time; the natural look is
an illusion. Tiny pieces of times as clocks build a life form,
to implement that design, clocks come, assemble. The natural
look is a follow up of the circuit of time, realized by matter.
If one isolates the matter, then reads the wrong information.
Why universality troubles computer scientists? The reason is simple for us, the concept of “Paper cut and glue,” that
we have extracted from the original document of Turing was
lost in history. Greatest mathematicians have wasted pages

Nanobrain

after pages “inside the paper or outside? ,” which they call
decidability issue. Can we write the statements such that it
is difficult to cut? Russel’s paradox (if one cuts the paper, he
cuts only one path, Russell, 1901) and many-body theorem
of physics. If several statements are connected, one has to sit
idle, wherever he cuts, he removes two paths. Then if he tries
to glue, he loses at least one path, this is a generic situation of
Russel’s argument. For a fractal tape, imagine that as soon as
one cuts a piece of argument, it becomes a new paper, and that
repeats forever. Figure 2.2c shows, how does a fractal tape process an image to build a complex time crystal. One interesting
factor is that when we cross the layer above, we end up into
a few numbers of low-frequency oscillators. Thus, automatic
simplification of the image is made by dilution of geometric
parameters via resonance chain (a geometric distribution of
resonance frequencies). When we go down below with a large
number of high-frequency oscillators, even a small part of the
image is expanded into various self-similar forms, and that
are then summed into a single pattern. Thus, the transition
to the low-frequency layers extracts fundamental grouping
parameters. While going to the lower frequency layers cause
fractal decomposition of the image and higher-level perception forms of an image. The back and forth journey are shown
in Figure 2.2c. The process chiefly shrunk nested rhythms for
an entire image, which we call fractal seed. In this process,
the phase sphere is cut off or sliced where there is a singularity domain, as shown in Figure 2.3a.

2.1.2 Self-Assembly of Geometric Shapes
and the Concept of Singularity
Which clock should we take to build time crystal:
Minkowski clock, Poisson clock, Nested clock in PPM:
Classical time is a near-equilibrium approach, in quantum,
the clock is deterministic? Minkowski clock is a sequence
of clocks wherein the higher frequency clocks traverse equal
distances around the world line, hence classical, as no phase
difference is observed between the two paths. If it is just twophoton clock and the frequency is increased say by ten times,
a spiral change in phase is visible, and this is the driving force
for spiral self-assembly. It could be explained using an imaginary number, but it is not a quantum (Ord, 1983). For quantum,
the trajectories follow several points before return to the base
point or a classical line like the sphere shown in Figure 2.3b,
so a phase difference is created. It is precisely the principle of
a Poisson clock, where the rate of decay and growth of a wave
creates the phase difference. One can write a clock as a tensor, a simple mechanism to write a tensor is to put tensor elements as characteristic parameters of the singularity domain
as described in Figures 2.3b and 2.4a.
Understanding the singularity in a time crystal: Space
singularity creates a spatial crystal, and the phase singularity
creates a time crystal. Time crystal does not have time within,
by closing a loop it defines a unit of time. Imagine many such
clocks are arranged in a 3D space; one could build infinite
close pathways by connecting the clocks. The topology of

loop. One has to wait for the singularity bursts to sense that
a circle has completed a rotation. Only then we can estimate
the phase structure; change in phase is time. That is why we
sense the phase singularity points and note the geometry
they reveal as shown for three and four singularities in the
Figure 2.3a and b. A good analogy is an electron rotating
around a complex orbit, on the phase sphere always there is
a circular orbit, but that orbit rotates with a phase velocity. If
the phase change makes a sudden jump and an energy packet
emits only then we get the information about a phase change,
else if there is an orbital jump we get different information.
Orbital transition is not our target, for detecting a time crystal
we wait when the rotation of an orbit reaches a singularity and
makes a jump, the energy emits naturally. So, a time crystal
is not about the clocking of an electron, a symmetry breaking
or phase transition when an electron jumps from one orbital
to another (Zeng, 2017), it is exclusively a topology of phase
singularity on the sphere only.
Mind-Car analogy: Several car drivers running cars, all
of their minds are connected, for a time crystal we are neither

interested in the time required to travel nor the path being traversed, but a sudden maneuver to avoid accidents is visible
which accounts for the interconnected state of the minds of all
the drivers. That sudden event is analogous to a burst from the
singularity and thus, reflects some features about the topology
in the melted-mind of the drivers. That static architecture of
phase singularities is the time crystal, an engine that bursts at
a singularity.
As the particles move the clocks run. Clocks interact,
singularities burst. The phase of the burst makes a quantum
jump in the architecture of time; thus, jumps build a time
crystal. The photon moves like a particle; it is not time; it does
not keep time; it is not a time crystal. However, if several photons interact, all clocks would run, change each other, that
is not time crystal. However, when interacting clocks jump
in phase, they reveal singularities. Only a time crystal reads
another time crystal. Since there is no signal propagation, it is
all about a match between two-time crystal releasing coherent
bursts and clocking signals from singularity points. Reading
each singularity points one by one is not possible.

work on an internal linear structure. For a time crystal, we
need a similar structure to sync with the time crystal that
we want to measure and in return let the singularity points
bursts signals. The solar system is a nested clock architecture
made of multiple planets and their sub-structures, if we see
them using a telescope, we do not read the time crystal, if
we plot a picture of their rotational path we do not draw the
time crystal. All the planetary bodies in the solar system have
phase recession motions, and that encounters singularities,
generating turbulence in the gravitational field distribution.
If we can map that disturbance and find its topology, a static
geometry that maps turbulence defines the time crystal of the
solar system. Now, a kid may shift the moon and generate turbulence in the gravitational field distribution; the time crystal
would change to another geometry, say a triangle converts to
a rectangle. It would be a non-demolition type measurement
where we try to change the time crystal continuously keeping both measuring and to be measured time crystals side by
side until there is a match. As soon as they match the two
types of signals emit. Two waveforms fuse. The first stream
of waveforms of different frequencies with a changing phase.

The second stream of complex waveforms as an amplitude
modulated signal. Bandyopadhyay et al. have studied a large
number of proteins, and their complexes and these two types
of signals generate continuously, that revealed the time crystal
(see Chapter 6 for details). Measurement is morphing between
two geometries whose corner points are made of singularities. Time of measurement is the time of the slowest clock,
not linear. So, in a time crystal computer, the computing time
is fixed by the slowest clock in operation.

2.2 THE BASICS OF A GEOMETRIC
MUSICAL LANGUAGE
To unveil the language of nature, at the bottom, we observe
which event (= equipment evoked response), not as a reply to
a question, but as an essential burst from singularity domain.
What we do is to observe how in a particular time domain
natural, spontaneous energy bursts repeat. How long the system responds and how long it remains silent. Our job is to
draw a circle and put dots on its perimeter to get a geometric
shape. That dot is silence. We believe that nature writes events

33

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

as geometric shapes not as bits and link events by putting new
geometric shapes inside the corners of one geometric shape.
Unlike bit by bit scenario, where a bit is a complete statement, here, each information is an infinite chain of interlinked
geometric shapes. We change the time domain an observer
would draw a geometric shape. Eventually, a genuine nature
reader has to cover entire time domain to find out the layered
network of geometric shapes one inside another, the repetition of geometric shapes assists in finding the seed geometric
shape and the grammar if followed, the complete information
architecture is generated. The pathway shown in Figure 2.4a,
a real structure to the tensor elements are phases of signal
bursts from singularities.
Time crystal analyzer, TCA: We need a language to
build artificial brain where the sound of words would be
felt in mind, understood, a perception would trigger similar waves in the human brain, even though the person does
not know the letters or grammar of that language. Inventing
a language that connects to the human brain directly, even if
we do not learn word’s significance is a challenge. For that
purpose, several replicas of sensory signals are processed
independently by a time crystal analyzer, TCA, looking into
different geometric parameters in big data. Then the signal is
converted into 11D time crystal, the input of TCA is a complex set of wave streams or ripples, and the output is a nested
sphere. The analysis is carried out so that the linguistic key,
event = [subject-clause-(verb-adjective)] is grabbed from
nature directly at the entry point and the purity of this form
is maintained at all levels while integrating the time crystal
and preparing it for sending it to the PPM. Acquiring 10D
data following linguistic protocols, requires asking questions
to nature, where the events take place, see Figure 10.1, where
we have outlined how TCA, the brain-nature interface forms
its queries to get a suitable quaternary linguistic demand.
TCA counts each event = [subject-clause-(verb-adjective)] as
a single abstract sphere, then a complex time crystal formed
by acquiring natural data (GML) becomes a network of integers, we convert it into a network of primes (4 = 2 × 2), so
that it is ready to go to PPM described in details in the next
Chapter 3.
The geometry of a language, primes of a geometry:
Whatever is the language, a statement has four parts. Who?
Alternatively, the subject. At which condition? The predicate.
What? The verb. How? The adjective. If one asks to put circles and draw a sentence, the circle that holds many subjects
is crossed by a circle holding many what. A circle on whose
perimeter many conditions are written, bridges the Who?
The conditions. The fourth circle on which the steps how an
event took place are written across the other three circles.
The crossing points of circles in the picture reveal the critical
links between the facts, and if a system point rotates through
all the circles making a sound at the cross-section, the gap
between the cross-section becomes phase, and that defines
the event. So, if we have a language where the phase is the
only variable, cross-sections are phase singularities, then
the engineering of singularity would build a new language.
Three points on a circle make a triangle. If the event is a

tetrahedron DNA like Figure 2.4a, how does one move from
one point to another? An addition of phase takes place when
we take the product of vectors, as the indices of exponential terms. PPM maps these bits of pieces by counting how
many ways we arrange them, and which of such arranged
structures would link to grow. Finally, only a set of numbers could represent a whole movie, with a past, present, and
future. There are only 15 geometric shapes, five lines, five
areas and five volumes as outlined in Figure 2.4b. However,
using a pair of clocks and rotating them one top of another,
we get the geometric shapes. Some examples of areas are
shown in Figure 2.4c. One of the fundamental problems of
nested clocks is that in practice, we could hardly generate a
finite number of clocks using materials. Just like when we hit
a tuning fork, we get infinite harmonics, for the clocks too,
similar to the fundamental clock, an infinite series of clocks
generate spontaneously.
Why do we use hyperbolic functions to ­generate geometric kernels? One key difference between resonance band with
harmonics and an infinite chain of clocks is that the clocks are
connected by geometric constraints. It is reported that the resonance band of the real human brain is a geometrical progression
of mean frequencies from band to band, roughly a ­constant ratio
of e ~ 2.7, i.e., the base of a natural ­logarithm, we get time fractal
using e −t, et = sinht + cosht , hyperbolic functions are continued
fraction too, just like the resonance band (see Section 2.7), for

fundamental constants that restrict us to add geometries
randomly in a 3D space. That restriction brings primes into
action, once we break the concept of linear distribution of
resonance frequencies and enter a continued fraction, as
shown above, spirals, vortices and fractals would make their
entry too.
What is meant by each geometric point connecting a
­circle, or sphere? Basic 1D, 2D, and 3D geometric shapes
shown in Figure 2.4b could be generated using hyperbolic functions, which is an infinite time series or rhythm.
A nested rhythm is an endless network of periodic or quasiperiodic oscillations (infinite series mathematically). Nested
rhythm = Nested clock = time crystal. Figure 2.4d shows
a static time crystal, though the clocks embedded in the
spheres are rotating, they do not change in size. In contrast,
Figure 2.4e shows a dynamic time crystal, where the spheres
are expanding and shrinking. Therefore, the existence of an
infinite series of clocks or the clocking spheres rapidly oscillating in size. Regarding the clock within a sphere, we take
only the ratios of connecting points, each contact point is a

−t
take three points, gf ((tt )) ~ 1− e t , then kg ((tt )) and kf ((tt)) . Three func1+ e
tions determine a rotation translation independent feature that
musicians also use to create a melody in the human mind.
Three relative functions are three time-fractals, which bond
together, by creating another function, as a host time fractal
that represents a triangle. The fused nested rhythm is the time
crystal, when we measure it, pure time crystal fundamental to
the system, becomes a guest on the host clock that measures it.
Using a simple analogy, we have explained it in Figure 2.5a.
In a classical or quantum measurement, the probe clock would
be invisible, but in the universal time crystal measurement,
the probe clock becomes a fundamental part of the system’s

clock. Normally, one atom forms a crystal, but to make an
artificial brain, we need composite clocks of various kinds,
just like composite materials. Therefore, we have shown in
Figure 2.5a, how three distinct clocks on a guest making four
clocks form the basic unit of a universal time crystal. Three
atoms form a triangle.
The case I: a demand from the linguists to hold on to the
basic definition of a sentence throughout the brain: In the
discussion above, we find that to hold a minimum geometric
shape that is a triangle we need four clocks. Even if we want
to create any 1D line, we need three points, two endpoints
and a curvature. Four clocks if resides one inside another,
tell another story. For the linguistic purpose all formulations

FIGURE 2.5 (a) There are four rows. The top row shows a phase sphere with a clock that represents the signal sent from outside to read
an inherent clock or time crystal residing inside a system. The second row from top shows the spontaneous generation of a new signal, in
principle not related to the input signal. The spontaneous clock disappears naturally after some time and the measuring input signal returns.
The third row from top shows that for a finite time period when the spontaneous clock operates a new clock is born in the system. The fourth
row from top, shows three-time crystal structures, the first one is the time crystal without measuring phase sphere, or measuring signal.
The central time crystal shows a new guest sphere that means three inherent clocks are there in the system, we call this universal time crystal
or UTC, because it holds geometric information. The central time crystal with the measuring phase sphere is shown in the right, during a
real experiment the triggering input signal also returns as an output. (b) A generic universal time crystal is made of four clocks, one real
and three in the layered imaginary worlds. These clocks form a quaternion of decision-making as shown in the right. In the responses of a
system, the real world is not the slowest clock. Who does it? The clock that answers this question is the slowest clock. The clock that answers
to the question, what it does? That represents the “Real world.” (c) The three basic principles for constructing a time crystal from a waveform. The amplitude of the waveform gives the diameter of the circle. The duration of spontaneously born signal provides the relative phase
between the clocks or the location of local clocks on the perimeter of the circle. Relative amplitude difference tells us by how much a guest
clock is inserted inside the host clock. (d) The common region between the two channels is bonding regions that glue two time crystal. (e)
If the common region between a pair of wave streams are not identical then the protocol followed is presented. (f) If two different channels
have a part in common, that part acts as a glue or common domain that links two time crystals.

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

analyzed in this book follows the structure of a statement
(e.g., Who? When? What? How? ), even the smallest unit of
information requires three imaginary worlds, i.e., a quaternary tensor as shown in Figure 2.5b. From any sequence of
wave streams, one could create a time crystal. By looking into
its ripples, the duration of one kind of ­signal gives the phase
of a guest circle representing a clock. The amplitude gives its
diameter. If the signal is perturbed, we could even map the
3D phase plot or 3D time crystal. One could fuse two timecrystals by looking into the common region in a pair of wave
streams. Figure 2.5d–f are three ideal cases. In Figure 2.5d,
everywhere, the streams are identical, except a small-time
domain. In Figure 2.5e, everywhere, the streams are identical
but follow a complex scenario. In Figure 2.5f we demonstrate
the real glue effect, where tiny time-domain showing a similarity between a pair of wave streams bond two time crystals.
The case II: Acquiring time crystal from the real
world by a time crystal analyzer, TCA: In the real world,
wave streams are not a linear singular non-modulated one
as shown earlier. In Figure 2.6a we show that in a complex
Complex waveforms

modulated wave, one has to find all frequencies engaged in
modulation, their duration, amplitude and repeatability are
checked to build a nested circle. When multiple wave streams
flow, their phase difference is collected and after placing a
reference point, the relative phase differences of the nested
clocks decide where on the perimeter we should put the system point (Figure 2.6b). In case the stream of pulses is so
noisy that we cannot recognize waveforms, then we could
take area covered by streams and or periodic patterns wherever possible. These periodic parts are stored as memory
units and the system of sensors looks for repetitions continuously (Figure 2.6c). All those areas where the program fails
to read any periodicity, geometric shape of those particular
time domain is read (Figure 2.6d). In order to confirm the
periodicity, a group of sensors could be hardwired to build a
polar plot that reveals hidden periodicity. Thus, without using
an algorithm, a set of resonators could sense hidden periodicities and build nested circles or clocks. Once the 2D clock
geometries are found, the system of clocks is perturbed to
find the 3D clock architecture.

6 × 2, or 3 × 4 and 4 × 3. Thus, the system finds links between the different integers in terms of their divisors. (g) A wave stream might find
oscillating clocks, this is important because oscillating clocks are used a mathematical variable. (h) A special composition of waveforms is

36

The case III: Searching for special clocks to learn
advanced dynamics: In the real world, search for linguistic
feature (Case I), and the search for hierarchical periodicities
(Case II), we introduce the search for symmetry (Case III).
For example, 12 means it could be 2 × 2 × 3, 2 × 3 × 2, or
3 × 2 × 2, in all situations. Say a system of oscillators senses
two possibilities of 12, then it would look for the third. Means,
from the stream of pulses if it finds a triangle with arms ratio
2:2:3 and 2:3:2 then at a certain time the triangle might morph
or change its shape to 3:2:2 (Figure 2.6f). Apparently, possibilities are infinite, but in reality, it is finite. In the PPM,
Reddy et al. have shown (2018) that pattern of primes connecting group of primes and integers could guide a system
of oscillators to naturally find the missing symmetries in the
input signal. A list of some patterns of metrics is listed in
Figure 3.4. The language of time crystals is being developed
to replace the world of differential equations and emulate the
natural phenomena (Figure 2.6g and h). Think in a reverse
direction. If a set of oscillators emulate a natural phenomenon
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010b, 2010c), then it would sense a
similar differential equation. Multiple natural phenomena are
described in Figures 2.6h and 4.1b. A tutorial is provided in
Figures 4.9 through 4.12, on how to draw circles and solve
complex mathematical problems.

2.2.1 How a 3D Structure Becomes a Time
Crystal or a Tensor: Non-differentiability
Non-differentiability makes rhythm or time ­
fractal
essential: Most of the spaces between “matters” are a vacuum,
in order to connect them, the energy should exchange between
any two elementary matters in a periodic fashion that is what
rhythm is, the periodicity is all about keeping time. Every period
has a time width that determines the frequency and clock limits
too. Moreover, always there should be wireless energy transfer,
because in the escape time worldview (zoom in to find other
worlds) nothing is touching each other. In the fractal universe,
the clocks face a unique situation, if the nested i­maginary worlds
are entirely made of time crystals. We explain the paradoxical situation using a network of cylinders in Figure 2.7a and b.
How do we get a cylinder? Imagine a clock is running, we get
a circle. Now, if the clock is perturbed, it would try to return to
the initial point. It would take a finite time, that makes a cylinder. In a fractal network, cylinders would trigger each other.
Then, generating a fractal time is possible if we have a change
∞
∞
in the potential ∅(t )= ∫0 β exp( − β t )θ ( β )d β , with ∫0 θ ( β )d β ,
let us consider the expression ∅(t ) = 1−aa ∑ ∞n =1 a nb nexp( −b nt ),
b < a < 1; in this expression β varies as b n and θ ( β ) varies like
a n, then the fractal time is ensured for b > a. In several working
environments, it has been documented that fractal time is generated (Shlesinger, 1988). In a practical fractal time scenario, the
average time is infinite. Wherever there is a situation where a
parameter changes with time such that the rate of variation is
proportional to the magnitude of the parameter itself, we get an
exponential variation and when it is stretched using power on
β
top of it, we get fractal time. One example is: ∅(t ) = exp[− (τt ) ],
where 0 <β <1.

Nanobrain

Fractal of meander flowers: The scaling law: Why FIT
must not have any conventional fractal in it: If the behavior
of a quantity say F (say light emission) is directly or almost
proportional to a scaling parameter s (say time or frequency
scale), such that F ( s ) ~ sα then the power law is valid over a
broad range of s values. It is the scaling law, if α is non-integer,
then it is a fractal. A fractal does not give new information, it
is a composition of the mirror images of the same information
repeatedly feedback on the higher scales. However, the network of cylinders shown in Figure 2.7c, representing a system,
where the cylinders are changing in length, pitch and diameter, would build wave vectors of various kinds. Excitation to
the recovery time of the clock or the cylinder length tells the
propagating wave along the cylinder surface, how many loops
it can make (Figure 2.7c). The loops around a center look like
a meander flower. Figure 2.7c could be plotted differently
like Figure 2.7d for better clarity. The horizontal axis shows
increment in recovery time, vertical axis frequency. The lines
are drawn to exhibit Hopf bifurcation, or allowed journey
through a series of breaking symmetry in the time crystal,
while a vertical column suggests that all flowers belong to
same symmetry. Thus, how the symmetries would change is a
geometric choice and those restrictions are mapped by a pattern of prime, i.e., PPM. Self-similarity is nowhere, but still
we sense a fractal everywhere, in all the gardens of meander
flowers. The artificial brain would be a garden of gardens,
GOG that picks branches of flowers to compose new flowers
for its garden (Figure 2.7e).

2.2.2 Fifteen Geometric Shapes Are Enough to
Recreate Any 1D, 2D, or 3D Pattern
Zooming the perimeter of a circle: Underprivileged and
superprivileged pixels: All the circles of a time ring oscillate continuously. During oscillation, it increases its diameter
together coherently (in-phase) and decreases to a single point.
That single point is also one pixel or the smallest phase cycle
(Ord, 2012). Say, one of the many connected pixels starts
oscillating in a different phase, for a particular time. Then it
returns to the same phase as its neighbor. The process repeats
with all the pixels one by one in a sequence. Then an external
observer sees as if a point is moving in a circle, or a clock
is born. Two such points hold an angle that enables encoding a geometric shape. For example, by shifting the position
of points, one can encode triangles of any shape. Similarly,
by using four points one can encode a rectangle, or square
and so on. Those pixels are privileged. Every pixel in a phase
cycle is another phase cycle or clock (Girelli et al., 2009), one
imaginary world’s lower limit is the upper limit of another
world. When the clocks change locations, it is not a crystal,
but a jelly. The jelly absorbs, writes and erases the time rings
or clocks to sync with its environment (Bandyopadhyay et al.,
2009b; Ghosh et al., 2016b), forms sensor of a different kind
(Figure 2.8a).

languages (Peyré and Cuturi, 2019), convert the entire image

FIGURE 2.7 (a) The mechanism of detecting a time crystal. First an existing periodic oscillation is perturbed, when, the existing waveform changes its basic parameters for a short time before returning to the same signal or phase reset happens three events can happen. First,
the system would return exactly when it suppose to begin its new period. Second, the system returns much earlier, and continues to spiral
oscillation. Third, it takes a much longer time than the next beginning of a new period. (b) R = Recovery time. There could be several
interconnected clocks which are triggered during the perturbation of one clock. (c) The recovery time shown in the panel b could change
as a function of input perturbation time and frequency of the signal used. Consequently, the pair of nested clocks change relative diameter,
phase positions, which generates a large number of time crystals. Each time crystal has only one system point and two clocks, hence we get
meander flowers, the entire plot is called meander flower garden. (d) The same meander flower garden plot like panel b but wave number is
replaced by frequency and the ratio of excitation to recovery time is also inversed. Two major lines of sequential generation of time crystals

flowers fuse and build a new flower.

on a single layer and considers only triangulation. Thus, it covers the entire 2D or 3D surface using triangles in a different
arrangement. Geometrification of data is good for aesthetics,
does not serve the purpose to represent the dynamics with
morphogenesis of a few geometric shapes.
Encompassing circle or sphere determines the time
domain: For example, irrespective of the sensory signal, be
it visual, auditory, touch, smell or taste, the 2D or 3D pattern
is created first as described in Figure 2.4d and e. Any change
in perspective or logic, means changes in those few geometric shapes. When we see an image, it is converted to a 2D isofrequency geometric patterns. Various geometric shapes are
detected in the image. Be it a line, curve or triangle, pentagon, all are inserted into a circle of a fixed area. However, the
contact point between the circle and the triangle would be the
most energetic. The conversion to circle happens for all possible 2D geometries, square, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon
etc. For an S, U, L, V, T, all 1D patterns convert to a straight
line and a circle simultaneously for the natural oscillation
of the network of an oscillator and platonic 3D geometries,

all structures convert to a sphere. These cross-sections of a
circle or sphere and the 2D, 3D geometric shapes get more
energy and these frequency values play a dominant role in
the further oscillations. As a result, we find that the ratio of
these contact point frequencies becomes the variable in the
hardware, which forms the rhythm since all-encompassing
circles of a particular imaginary world have nearly the same
area the ratios play a crucial role in defining the essential
terms of the rhythm.
A platonic love letter to Big Data: In principle, we could
randomly choose geometric shapes and find them in the
natural events and use those very shapes to assign complex
geometric shapes to the integers in the PPM. However, 1D,
2D, and 3D geometries are selected mathematically to serve
as an analogy to the Platonic geometries (five Platonic solids
are tetrahedron (or pyramid), cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron). For 2D, we take triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, for 1D a few letters like L, V/U, C
(S = 2C), O. Sensors search only for these fifteen geometries,
each with a distinct value of S in a massive rapidly changing

very important in processing prime number of channels, 7,13,19,31,37,43 all these primes could be processed by a hexagonal closely packed
channel bundles or nerve fibers. In other words, whenever, there is a hexagonal close pack bundle, the dynamics against the central fiber
or channel gives all six primary primes. Even, other primes, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, 47 are just one less than the hexagonal lattice. Which means
when central channel is silent we get 6 primes, when active we get six primes, total 12 prime related dynamics could be processed by a
hexagonal close-packed structure with only 48 channels. (g) Electromagnetic, ionic or other energy bursts are the signatures of a singularity

database of events, not by looking into the content, but, in a
matrix of dataset, which is converted into a rapidly changing topology. In TCA, any information is converted into a
1D, 2D or 3D…10D geometric shape. Conversion to a shape
ignores the actual content, converts the big data stream into
a spatial flow of fluid as a function of time or phase. In the
rapidly changing 3D distribution of data, imagine it could
be a 3D cubic glass chamber filled with clouds one finds the
most inactive and the active points that appear, disappear or
change periodically. Active points are those which bursts like
a lightening; inactive points are those who remain silent in
the 3D glass chamber.
Looking for absolute peace and war zones in a Big
Data: Say, there are three active points, it means the total

no of primes p + q + r = 3, the finding of three key locations in the data confirms that it needs three primes to reveal
the hidden dynamics. Then in the glass chamber, one has to
further monitor the ratio of spatial distance between the three
points (e.g., p:q:r::2:3:2), to find the ratio in terms of closest
primes to a distinct integer, start from 2, try to use the smallest and nearest primes. In a rapidly changing big data, represented as a fluid flow, if we see the silent and the most active
domains are changing with the ratios 2:2:3, 3:2:2, 2:3:2, we
understand it is a clocking triangle (S = 3), and the corresponding integer is 12. We do not take the ratio of integers but
convert to the nearest ratio of primes. Why are only primes
taken? Many triangles with similar ratios e.g., 3:5:3, 11:19:11,
19:37:19 etc which builds an infinite series of triangles in

39

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

the PPM, superposition of all those triangles covers a pure
noise in sensing the input, the ratios cannot be deduced to
non-prime forms like 3:6::1:2. A given geometry = An infinite
series in the PPM. In the GML, the corner points embed distinct geometric shapes inside to grow within, and the whole
shape acts as a corner point, assemble with similar points to
build a geometric structure above. Hence the corner points
at any layer, are the singularity points. In GML when we see
a structure, the first thing we do, is to find which geometric
shape represents the whole. Then the shapes grow within and
above, not side by side. Each shape is placed in a sphere, its
corners touch the sphere’s surface, a clock derived from fluid
flow runs on the sphere’s surface touching all the singularity
points or corners of the geometric shape. Such an assembly of
the clock is defined as a time crystal.

2.2.3 How to Convert Waveforms into a
Time Crystal: Non-differentiability
We have described above how to convert 1D, 2D and 3D data
into time crystals. Here is a critical review of the technical
procedure.
1. Unless we find three clocks at least, a guest clock and a
host clock, i.e., a linguistic quaternion, keep searching.
The clocks in a neural system self-assemble to modulate the time (Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis, 1968).
For this purpose, a need for three clocks is observed
in some bio-systems (Berliner and Neurath, 1965).
Who?What?Why?How? must be found to write a basic
unit of information.
2. The central clock (phase cycle = clock; Ord, 2012)
survives even if the environment edits the two boundary clocks (Prati, 2009); i.e., slower and the faster
ones. In such three-layered clock, a time crystal
turns naturally fault-tolerant; i.e., breaking of time
symmetry is uninterrupted. As Figure 2.8d explains,
one requires three kinds of sensors. The first one that
is specialized in particular symmetry breaking, and
specific time domain. The second one that integrates
different sensors or fuses widely varied symmetry
breaking regions and time domains. The third one
is good in projecting a given set of symmetries to
infinity and return feedback to adjust the geometry
hidden in the time crystal it just sensed.
3. The number of singularity points on the primary
phase cycle of a host is the number of guest clocks
(Aschoff and Wever, 1976). It is the number of different time flows experienced by a system point as
it moves 360°. Each clock can have its system point
and can grow its phase cycle structure or time crystal
inside by making a new guest-host system. It can connect with neighboring time crystals or phase cycles
as guests of a larger phase cycle. It is self-assembly
of time crystals side by side (Pippinger and Fischer,
1979; Gurevich and Shelah, 1989) or one inside
another (Ghosh et al., 2014a). Symmetry breaking

makes life, as claimed by many (Kuhn, 2008), here,
symmetry breaking is searched in the input data to
find linguistic decisions Who-What-Why-How in a
totally unknown environment.
4. The relative locations of the system points, estimate
the initial phase differences among different clocks.
It significantly changes the output measurement of
the time crystal. To re-assemble the disintegrated
parts of a time crystal, reviving the initial phase difference between clocks is essential. Such a phase
reset is abundant in biology (Best, 1976; Bruce et al.,
1960), thus, biological systems have a memory to
remember the phase gaps of various clocks.
5. When a time crystal has only two clocks then a 2D
plane is sufficient to represent. If there are three
clocks, then 2D phase cycles orient as a 3D sphere.
Since three singularity points ensure holding a triangular geometric shape, this is a clocking Bloch
sphere. The time crystal becomes information storage and processing device.
6. A spatial crystal appears different, from different directions. Its response remains the same as it
is determined by the lattice symmetry. For a time
crystal, different rotational directions of a system
point in the phase cycle measure different responses.
It depends on three parameters. First, the relative
phase difference between the clocks. Second, the
relative location of the clocks. Third, the relative
diameter of the clocks.
7. The repetitive patterns of densely connected phase cycles
are denoted as a “mass” in a 3D phase structure, when
observers time crystal cannot resolve the distinct clocks
in the 3D phase architecture depicted as a time crystal.
Then the relative perimeter of the longest phase cycles of
the observer and that of the object or event under measurement is defined as “space.” Thus, “clock” made of
phase paths wire events, one gets a circuit of mass, space
and time (Prati, 2009; Ord and Mann, 2012).
8. All singularity points may remain intact, that is,
no change is observed in the resonance frequency
band, yet, it is possible that time crystal is changing its symmetry. The relative phase path between
frequencies changes. To make a crystal, one has to
fit multiple phase cycles inside a longer phase cycle,
such nesting of phase is meticulously designed
in biology (Betz and Becker, 1975). As described
above, the singularity points residing on a phase
cycle represent a geometric shape. A small perturbation to a system by applying a noise of selected
frequency range reveals the singularity points, just
like a noise reveals the Fermi level. Perturbation creates a ripple of phase shifts (Johnsson and Karlsson,
1971). The relative rotations of the phase cycles are
restricted by the topological constraints. The topology of the phase response curve reveals the variables
and the constraints (Kawato and Suzuki, 1978).
The desired 1D, 2D and a 3D time crystal structures

40

form (Ghosh et al., 2014b, 2015b, 2016b). The formation could be linked to the pattern of primes.
9. A time crystal is an artwork of singularity points
connected by phase, not a single point in it is real.
There is no time, space, or mass, it is a network of
phase (Girelli et al., 2009). The phase shift is the only
event in the information processing, caused either
by changing the input frequency (Chandrashekaran
and Engelmann, 1973) or by the intensity of the light
pulse (Chandrashekaran and Loher, 1969). Time
crystal represents any information as topology and
every topology or geometric shape is a single point
or corner point in its higher topology.
10. The appearance of time crystal depends on three
parameters. First, the observer’s phase-detection
resolution. Second, the relative phase between the
observer and the time crystal. Third, the orientation
of the observer.
11. The time crystal dynamics strictly depends on the
topology of singularity. Neither classical nor quantum
mechanics address the issue of singularity. In a classically static resonance band one could measure quantum
fluctuations of phase paths. In a random fluctuation of
the phase path of quantum, one could find topology of
phase structure following fractal mechanics.

2.3 THE BASIC CONCEPT OF A TIME CRYSTAL
AND THE GARDEN OF GARDENS (GOG)
How the garden of gardens converts 4D to 8D to 12D?
We have described above the fundamentals of a garden of
gardens, GOG in Figure 2.7e. GOG is an important concept,
because the sensors at the interface level, when enters into
the brain, captures 11D data, i.e., clocks are spread over 12
layers one inside another, but at a time, clocks in four layers undergo changes for a quaternion tensor. So, we get 4D
dynamics in an 11D data structure. Now, an advanced sensor
has to integrate several sensory inputs to build 8D dynamics
in an 11D data structure and finally, build up 12D dynamics.
The flowers in the GOG are not real flowers that come from
environmental input as shown in Figure 2.7e. Geometric similarities in the meander flowers coming from different sensors
as 4D dynamics are matched and picked up by the system to
build flowers that would bridge sensors. For example, say the
visual sensor is capturing 4D dynamics where the imaginary
worlds, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 12th are changing simultaneously
the geometric shapes written in their time crystal. Now, if a
sound sensor captures 4D dynamics, where 1st, 5th, 7th and
8th imaginary worlds, the higher-level sensor would notice
that 7th and 8th imaginary worlds are undergoing simultaneous changes. Then, it would see, if similar geometric shapes
are found in the respective time crystals. If the higher-level
sensor (Figure 2.8a) finds that 8th imaginary world of visual
sensor and the sound sensor is undergoing a change of geometric shapes of a very similar kind. Then like Figure 2.5d–f,
the sensor picks up similar geometries and builds a new
meander flower that never came as an input, but may belong

Nanobrain

to 11th imaginary world. The process is shown in Figure 2.7e.
Thus, 4D data converts into an 8D dynamics and then to 12D
dynamics. How two imaginary worlds interact and the third
imaginary world gets affected? This magic happens because
of the dodecanion and octonion tensors, just give a look to the
tensors in Figure 4.13. In summary, invisible pathways connecting the cells and pattern of primes linking and governing
the evolution of events within and outside the hardware are
two key features that make fractal tape original.

2.4 HOW TO DESIGN A SENSOR
FOR ACQUIRING 11D DATA
The GOG operation described above for three types of sensors to acquire 11D or 12D data (do not worry, classical and
quantum mechanics have one real world, here no real world,
hence 11D = 12D), requires a new hardware operational
mechanism to search and find a similar geometric match in
the time crystal.
Simultaneous electrical, mechanical and magnetic
resonance: The key to sense 11D data: A single oscillator
vibrates like a clock when it is periodically pumped from outside and eliminate its damping. The feedback circuit should
harvest abundant thermal noise, chemical energy, mechanical
motions, in this book we have emphasized a unique energy
harvesting regulatory mechanism. It is recently reported
(Ghosh et al., 2016a) that electrical, magnetic and mechanical
resonance frequencies of specific biomaterials are connected
by a quadratic relation ( e 2 + φ 2 = π 2 ), which ensures canalizing three forms of noise into a signal of another kind. Means,
electrical noise would feed to mechanical and magnetic
clocks, mechanical noise into magnetic and electrical clocks
and magnetic noise into electrical and mechanical clocks.
It was an important discovery because until then all efforts
to create a long-running clock was to feed a similar type of
energy, which failed in every possible manner. Following a
quadratic mathematical control in the hardware, it is possible
to generate much longer running clocks. Fourth-circuit element H, could implement this typical feature, see Chapter 8.
The philosophy behind this intra-conversion is beautiful.
A noise activates a search mode for the feedback channel, the
active device that executes the quadratic relation has three
pairs of energy levels, a pair each for mechanical, electrical
and magnetic energy transmission.
How does the e − π − φ sensor work? Most resonance
frequencies of the electrical energy are driven by ions or
electrons emerge in the ratio of Pi (3.14..). Most magnetic
resonance frequencies made of a vortex of loop currents or
magnetic flux develop resonance frequencies with the golden
ratio Phi (1.61..). The mechanical resonance frequencies made
of soliton or diffusing molecules in a cavity, vibrating strings
are in the ratio of e (2.73….). Quadratic relation means, if the
magnetic and the electric resonance frequencies shift in a certain way, the change in the resonance frequency of mechanical vibration is fixed and vice versa. Geometric control of
feedback mechanism is a key to harvest noise, two-way feedback fails, but three-way feedback ensures one-way energy

41

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

transfer, hence it is stable. If a tape is a linear chain of oscillators, then it would produce time fractals or rhythms (Muller,
2009). Corrections by noise are carried out at all levels since
higher-order terms in the infinite series do take part in keeping the quadratic relation intact. It is a careful observation
that nature uses geometry to link distinctly operating time
domains, where the corrections run through each term of an
infinite series. The frequency spectrum for each cell determines the limiting times for the tape inside that cell. In other
words, the limiting times of energy bursts of the lower layer
cells of a fractal tape are the maximum temporal resolution of
the upper layer tape.

2.4.1

Why Fast Fourier Transform Does Not Work

The artificial brain must explore the unseen in the most
scenic picture: Fast Fourier Transform, FFT is widely used
to convert a wave stream into a single or multiple frequency
peaks. Here, while describing time crystal analyzer, TCA, we
noted that different frequency peaks built by FFT would never
capture the simultaneous shifts of multiple peaks as a group,
possibility of a group of groups, the existence of singularity
points, the dynamics of relative phase changes between multiple wave streams. It was never thought that multiple parallel channels could hold interactive relationships as described
in Figures 2.5 through 2.7, which would require analogs of
nerve bundles or cortical columns (Figure 2.8b). The collective evolution of patterns in the simultaneously operating parallel channels as shown in Figure 2.8c and d suggests that one
system point creating one channel in a clock is not isolated
and distinct. Even in one channel that carries one system point
in a complex time crystal structure, the hierarchical geometric information is absolutely neglected in the FFT. A single
pulse stream could not just hold hierarchical groups of local
patterns distantly located in the time series, but geometric
shapes, widely varied information even within a single waveform were never taken into account in FFT.
An eleven-dimensional pattern to link all events: projection from infinity: Imagine, we are given a random set of
events and we want to link them without knowing anything
about the particularity of events, is it possible? We always
think what we see is real, like sun rotates around the earth,
or the earth is flat, but it could be that what we measure,
actually it is spontaneously giving us what we already have?
Then there is no measurement, there is no detection, there is
no searching, it is replaced by a spontaneous reply. So, when
all the events are interconnected, we cannot solve it, right.
However, we can imagine two hardware that is made of the
same protocol to link an unknown number of events into a
universal pattern. The universal pattern never repeats itself
totally, but 12 significant features repeat scale-free through
infinity. Anything that is born from this hardware is a piece
of an infinitely long, endless chain of pattern, it evolves with
time to enrich itself, perfecting the protocol to link events.
The hardware learns that means it increases the length of integral choices, in the course of enriching, once the topology
of evolving geometry saturates by absorbing matter, cannot

add more choices, it saturates or dies. Our job is to accurately
detect the repeating features in the pattern of choices using
which we link events, that mathematics would require a new
information theory, a new language GML and a metric of
choices PPM. Figure 2.8f and g explain how the choice of
symmetries in the cables could enable a sensor to read the
dynamics of primes or symmetry of events naturally without
any effort. Thus, the culture of FFT sensors is very different
from the kind of e − π − φ sensors running the time crystal
analyzer, TCA.

2.4.2 The Engineering of a Nerve Bundle
in Acquiring Hidden Data
The engineering of pixels: the door to different imaginary
worlds: The duration of silence and active signal bursts in a
nerve bundle carries time crystals of 12 imaginary worlds
(Figure 2.8c and d). Multi-channel simultaneous energy
transfer among different imaginary worlds is difficult to picturize, it is like suggesting that something that does not exist
or impact us. The idea is to bypass singularity or the nondifferentiable points by redefining pixels. When we zoom
a circle to a level where we see a finite number of circles
as pixels, we can pick one such circle or pixel, and inside
that the other imaginary world would survive. Since anything inside a pixel is undefined the world inside is imaginary, but that world can define the property of the pixels,
thus, affecting across the singularity point. When we discuss
the 200 years old mathematical journey of octonions, and
introduce the magical automation of 12 imaginary worlds
that has no real-world, bonds with observer’s similar time
crystals, then hand waving argument that phase exchange
would do the job is not enough. Either nerve bundle or a time
crystal carrier would create a larger singularity encompassing the entire geometric shape, or fill in the blanks inside a
singularity: Singularity points of a Bloch sphere bursts in a
sequence, clockwise or anti-clockwise to hold the geometric
shapes, that is the memory of a cable transmitting time crystal. These singularity points burst signals by harvesting noise
in the biomaterials (Kuramoto, 1983). Burst from the pixel
is a crude expression of a manifold complex processing happening the imaginary world inside.
The illusive transmission through the nerve ­bundle:
In the conventional mathematical formulations of physics
where the differential equation plays a dominant role, a new
version of GML has been created, it is called continued fraction geometric algebra, CFGA (Chapter 4). Then the laws of
equations would be written by drawing, changes in the geometric shapes. We often find multilayered materials that can carry
4D, 8D and 12D tensors. For example, the core-shell nanostructures, dendrimers and various other organic supramolecular architectures where one could experimentally measure
that for any layer of the structure, an energy transfer occurs
from its bottom to the top and then simultaneously from top
to bottom. We do not need a pathway, nerve bundles arrange
in geometry to hold a particular type of clocks, we mistake
an effective information-processing organ as transmission

42

cables. The pattern of prime hardly repeats. The beauty of
the pattern of primes (Figure 3.4) to retain self-similarity as
different integer scale originates via projection from the infinity that governs very different kinds of dielectrics and forces
of interactions into self-similar spatial variations. On a tiny
scale, the quantum principles work, at a larger scale, weak
interactions and strong molecular binding work, and then at
the largest scale, electromagnetic effects come into play. Scale
changes from atomic to meters (1012), time changes femtoseconds to say 100 years (10 −9 to 1015 Hz), e − π − φ sensors do
their job 1:100 scales between space and time.

2.4.3 Operational Chart of a Sensor
By synthesizing the organic jelly, a neural network like
supramolecular structure was built (Ghosh et al., 2014b,
2015b, 2016b). That brain jelly is poured in a fractal dielectric, designed similar to a brain. The organic jelly-made
device of time clocks morphs the EEG features of a human
brain. The clock-like crystallization of materials is unique
(Brumberger, 1970).
How sensory input integrates by GML: Geometric
shapes built from sensors can integrate two ways; side-byside and one inside another. The corner points of geometric
shapes break, and then one inserts a geometric shape in it
(Figure 2.8h). Thus, geometries grow side by side and one
inside another. It is not a 2D structure. The integrated geometric shapes are best represented in a clocking Bloch sphere.
When it integrates information bubbles of Bloch spheres would
grow (Agrawal, 2016b). When a time ring holds more than one
geometric shape, any of them could represent a query and the
other, an answer, together, QA couplet. Therefore, when the
clock runs, the decision is made for a query. The existing 3D

assembly of the Bloch sphere adds new sets of nested clocks
or bubbles with its surface (Vitiello, 2012). During the addition, it even undergoes a phase transition just like an organic
supramolecule (Ghosh et al., 2014b, 2015b, 2016b). The rule
for a phase transition is the same, “symmetry breaking.” Here
the 3D oriented structure of phase cycles is an alternative to
the program or algorithm. When synchronized clocks run
together, every time, synchrony selects new wiring (Mirollo
and Strogatz, 1990). To an external query, all the associated
clocks run. All the issues related to a query are built into one
single Bloch sphere structure; no choice is left out.

2.5 COMPARATIVE STUDIES BETWEEN WINFREE,
WILCZEK, AND THE UNIVERSAL TIME CRYSTAL
Frank Wilczek’s version of time crystal contradicts
Winfree’s version: Frank Wilczek revived the lost time crystal of the 1990s in 2012 (Shapere and Wilczek, 2012). There is
no guest-host phase cycle in Frank’s version, i.e., the guest’s
singularity is not explored in the way others did for 40 years
(Figure 2.9). The follow-up works have surprisingly rejected
the concept of singularity. An external energy input signal oscillates the diameter of a given time cycle by beating.
After a while, the original cycle returns (Zhang et al., 2017;
Else et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2017). It is like the orbital transition of an electron in a molecule. Such shreds of evidence
neither support classical nor quantum time crystals. Temporal
oscillation of the diameter of a phase cycle is found in multiple systems. Periodicity in the quantum ground state alone
is not enough evidence to justify a time crystal. Therein two
different time symmetries do not coexist. If we detect one, citing uncertainty, it violates the basic definition of a time crystal.

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

Two kinds of time symmetries should coexist, with or without entanglement (Choi et al., 2017), the uncertainty that we
need in quantum would be in the phase path. Now, the change
in the phase path is not much investigated in the history of
quantum, it requires an understanding of topology when one
fuses multiple Hilbert spaces. Frank’s version therefore has
not two, but one phase cycle, it contradicts the definition of a
crystal. Frank Wilczek’s proposal is also tagged “impossible”
(Bruno, 2013). Comparison between the universal time crystal
that Reddy et al advanced from the Winfree era, bypassing
the current sensation of a time crystal, suspecting that it needs
severe corrections.

2.6 THE DEFINITION OF A QUATERNION,
OCTONION, AND DODECANION
Spheres of different unit vectors originating from the
different imaginary worlds: Normally a fractal is f ( z n ),
for example, the Mandelbrot fractal, z 2 = z + c, here, we get
z n = rpn ( cosp ( nθ p ) + sinp ( nθ p ) ). Order p harmonic would be

43

the function, when p = −1, it is a single burst like events, and
when p = 0,1 then we get wave equation, both in the imaginary
and in the real worlds, it means we get time fractal or rhythms
propagating across the tape network. The physical significance
of p is feedback, a particular rhythm should have a particular
type of feedback from the imaginary spaces or times, hence a
constant p. Time fractal or rhythm made of multiple p values
f ( z np1, z np 2 ,… z npm ), m is the escape number, each time one enters
inside a tape to find a new tape adds value to m. Figure 2.10a
and b shows one to one correspondence between the linguistic
structure of an event and imaginary world representation of
tensors whose each element holds peculiarities of a singularity point, i.e., coordinates on the phase sphere, clock speed,
burst energy etc. In the human brain network how different
components contribute to the higher-dimensional tensors are
outlined.
The dodecanion or icosanion is a combination of
dodecanes (or 12-tuples) of real numbers. Every dodecanion is a real linear combination of the unit dodecanions
{h0 , h1, h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 , h7, h8, h9 , h10 , h11,}; where h0 is the scalar
or real element; it may be identified with the real number 1.

The central row shows 8D information structure. Mostly the sensors are designed to process octonions, its time crystal representation is
shown to the right. The time crystal representation is the cage that holds information content as singularity shape. Similar cage is shown for
the decision-making of an artificial brain in the third row. Three rows show the vector expression of generalized dodecanion algebra, which
is tensors. (b) The tensor representation of a quaternion. Four basic questions build a quaternion. Who does it? At what condition? What does

That is, every dodecanion for 12 planes or icosanion for 12
corners x can be written in the form
x = h0 x0 + h1 x1 + h2 x2 + h3 x3 + h4 x 4 + h5 x5
+ h6 x6 + h7 x7 + h8 x8 + h9 x9 + h10 x10 + h11 x11
The dodecanion x spreads over eleven imaginary layers
located one inside another. When a new class of sensors finds
11D time crystals from the environment, one requires specialized hardware to hold the time crystal, and dodecanion
is the data form used. Addition and subtraction of quaternions, octonions and dodecanion (Conway and Smith, 2003) are
done by adding and subtracting the corresponding terms and
hence their coefficients, but we need a multiplication table to
find the product as shown in the Figure 4.13. While processing
a time crystal, the wave functions representing the clocks
in the different imaginary worlds multiply, a multiplication
table maps the effect of two coupled or entangled worlds.
However, dodecanion multiplication is neither commutative,
hi h j = −h j hi ≠ h j hi , if i, j are distinct and nonzero; nor associative, ( hi h j ) hk = −hi (h j hk ) ≠ hi (h j hk ), if i, j , k are distinct, nonzero and hi h j ≠ ± hk . There is an association, but that link is a
bit complex.
The origin of geometric algebra lies in the arrangement
of sub-tensors of a given tensor. At the lowest level there is
a di-nion tensor where only one imaginary world counts.
Quaternion has three, octonion has seven and dodecanion or
icosanion has eleven imaginary worlds at a time, one of the
imaginary worlds (that one could be any) becomes a reality
for the observer. Recently, efforts have been made to dilute
the distinction of imaginary worlds and use linear vectors to
regulate the evolution of imaginary worlds in quantum thus
build quantum logic gate (Freedman et al., 2018). However,
all these efforts dilute the distinction, the linear vectors made
of multiple imaginary worlds do not explore the most exciting feature of multiple imaginary worlds. That is the communication between imaginary worlds. The formation of linear
vectors taking one contribution from each of the available
imaginary worlds is again returning to the Turing’s information processing paradigm. Linear composition puts all
solutions on a single-phase sphere, so, one could imagine
that century-old Bloch sphere to represent infinite possible
pulse trains (Figure 2.10c). Universal time crystal endorses
singularity, the clocking geometries i.e., quaternions hidden
in the octonion, while octonions are hidden in the dodecanion. Thus, many phase spheres form a 3D arrangement of time
crystals, we build a GML.

2.7 THE BASIC CONCEPT OF A HIGHERDIMENSION DATA: A LUCID PRESENTATION
A journey through 12 dimensions or 11D as outlined in
Figure 2.11a is easy to learn if we remember one question “who jumps? ” as outlined in Figure 2.11b. 11D concept is built on three worldviews. Real-world spanning
over 0D–4D that we can easily picturize in our mind feel

with our senses. Then the geometric phase world where we
could use advanced instruments and detect that changes
are happening in the 5D–7D region. Finally, using pen and
paper and doing only math we may simulate and extrapolate experimental observation to understand there could be
a mathematical world with 8D–11D. Always remember,
something should jump through an imaginary space to create a higher dimension. Points jump to create a straight line,
we move from 0D to 1D. Lines jump to create an area we
move from 1D to 2D. The table of Figure 2.11a and b are the
same, one we do not picturize the other is easy to feel. One
interesting thought, the followers of the artificial geometric
brain should note the third row of Figure 2.11b, irrespective of dimension always there is a quaternion, the linguistic
core has to be preserved like an idiom. The journey above
5D requires the PPM, where the geometric correlation of
primes or integers guides us to make the jump to a higher
dimension. Below we discuss which clock one brain builder
should choose to create an artificial brain that emulates
Figure 2.11a and b.
Clocks of imaginary layers as particles in the ­pattern of
primes: When one feeds tensors representing the collection
of phase values to the pattern of prime, PPM, the phase values are automatically edited since all imaginary worlds have
their distinct clocks. Then for the first time when we enter
into the world of 11 dimensions in a dodecanion, we encounter the superposition of clocks (see Figure 4.13). Between two
classical observations, which lies along the horizontal axis of
primes, the system point passes through various choices by
which elementary events could be arranged. For a particular
tape, this is indeterministic, but for an external observer, it is
deterministic if the observer sees all imaginary worlds at a
time, but not if the number of worlds is 12, i.e., a dodecanion
tensor. Then the coexistence of multiple groups of imaginary
worlds (2 × 2 × 3, 2 × 3 × 2, 3 × 2 × 2) creates a higherlevel topology that could represent a non-accessible clock.
The trajectory of the phase is not spiral anymore, and it is a
spiral of a spiral of a spiral… go eleven times! In Poisson, it
is random, in fractal space-time is fractal, and the fabric is
the imagination of a physicist. In general, in the PPM metric, it is like a vortex of spirals, many spirals converging to
one point, for each prime there is a dedicated metric, or a
grammar to fuse the clocks, but even specific numbers like
6, 8, 9 even they have distinct PPM (Figure 3.4). Minkowski
clock gives the space-time, Poisson clock plays with the twin
paths to generate the quantum world, but in PPM, multiple
spirals generate from every prime number point in the world
line. Therefore, instead of just getting one imaginary spacetime world like in quantum for the Poisson clock (i 2 + 1 = 0),
we need multiple space-time worlds surviving together, so
we need i 2 + p = 0. The value of p varies between 0 and
−1; exact values of p could be determined. The stress created by the sum of all vortices generates the time series
2
f ( t ) = a0 + a1 ( t − ti ) + a1 ( t − ti ) +  thus, a time fractal
or frequency fractal is the perceived mass in PPM clock,
while in Poisson clock, it is the fundamental vibrational frequency of the matter, a single value (Compton frequency).

FIGURE 2.11 (a) A table explains the 11 dimensions in terms of a GML. Using three arrows three worlds are explained, real-world for
dimension up to 4D that deals with quaternion, octonion and dodecanion. The second world view 5D–7D, is tagged as geometric phase
world where 1D structures are knots of darkness or interference induced structures. 2D loops represent 2D structures, and 3D Euclidian
surfaces are used to represent the 3D architectures. From 8D to 12D information is classified as Mathematical world, 12 equations are keys
in engineering of the mathematical world that would govern an artificial brain. (b) The concepts of 12 dimensions, how to easily understand
how the engineering of 12 dimensions is realized. There are three rows in this table. The first row explains “what jumps?” the answer tells
how to realize a dimension going one level above. The second row shows how the data looks like in the operational brain. The third row
shows quaternion representation of the decisions. Note that in the brain, be it a structure of octonion or dodecanion, eventually the data is
arranged as a quaternion.

So, in simple terms, instead of De-Broglie’s “particle and
wave,” Copenhagen’s “particle or wave,” in the PPM metric
we use “particle is a typical network of the wave.”

2.8 A COMPARISON BETWEEN GML
AND SOFTWARE ALGORITHM
A time crystal is naturally a seed of an a­ stronomical number of events: Encodes event dynamics as soon as it reads
time crystal: The time crystals interact with the environment, morphs perpetually, like biological systems (Clark and
Steck, 1979). Nature never stops changing. Interfacing clocks
of time crystals never fully stabilize into a solid phase structure. Therefore, a standalone time crystal is not a solid but jelly,
wherein, correlated geometric shapes construct an interactive

matrix. Its phase flips, resembling a jelly. If nature triggers
any of the elements or the clock, it ripples the entire matrix.
Time crystals do not need to be programmed to suitably linking with new clocking Bloch spheres. Only feasible compositions allowed mathematically are automatically embedded in
the PPM which guides the integration of newcomers. Phase
connected 3D network of geometries cannot be linearized into
a sequence of tasks, like a software algorithm (Figure 2.12).
Therefore, it emulates nature like a universal sensor. In most
cases, the 3D clocking geometry could be accessed in astronomical ways. Even if one twists input in an incredibly large
number of ways, yet the structure would sync reliably. In a time
crystal of ten clocks, each clock with eight possible connecting
routes can coexist with 108 ways.
PPM addresses the automaton concern of Turing:
Output is always higher than the input: Since basic

geometric shapes are finite, only 15, and PPM based computing hardware uses only 15 primes, which covers a significant domain of information processing happening in
nature, PPM hardware co-exists in the environment, discrete
isolation occurs nowhere. Then how could an engine operate and deliver an independent solution? It was Turing’s primary objection to analog the computers in his “Lecture on
the Automatic Computing Engine” (1947), that additional
accuracy in analog machines is costly to obtain. For optical
machines, for example, we have to progress to shorter and
shorter wavelengths of light. For a machine of a given physical cross-section, this means that the energy consumption of
the analog machine will grow as the cube of the accuracy
required, whereas for a classical digital machine the energy
consumption growth is more like nlogn, n is the number of
steps. In PPM, the derived solution could have no relation
whatsoever with the input because geometric shapes could
arrange continuously in a new way. The infinite number of
primes and an encounter with a prime enables the creation of
3D geometry or evolution of an event that may not have any
signature left of the input (Figure 2.12).

2.8.1 Historical Background on Hypercomputing
and Super-Turing Hypothesis
Undecidability, Halting problem and the necessity of
self-programmable algorithm: The most arrogant statement about the universe is the following: anything that can
be “computed” can be computed by some Turing machine.
Turing himself in 1938 started to find the limitations of the
Turing machine (Turing, 1939). Undecidability is not possible to resolve using Turing machines. One example problem is a question, how much time would require to find all

prime numbers? Now, once this question is asked, the Turing
machine is not designed to simulate the future and accordingly create an algorithm (self-taught software), estimate
computing time feasibility of solution making and halt if it
cannot finish within finite time (halting problem). Each clock
in the time crystal is an infinite loop, thus, an infinite loop
cannot fall into an infinite loop and get locked.
Zeno machine and Fractal machine: A comparative
approach: A Zeno machine is inspired by Zeno Paradox
(Hermann Weyl, proposed it in 1927; Weyl, 1949), which
argues that motion cannot happen if we follow the conventional thoughts, using uncertainty principle one could explain
it, or using one imaginary world of quantum mechanics.
In Zeno machine a fractional number of an infinite series
is considered and it is argued that, since the infinite series
converges to a finite number, the computing time will be
finite. All terms, if put together, becomes a fractal. The infinite time Turing machine is a generalization of the Zeno
machine (Hamkins and Lewis, 2000). For Fractal machine
at least twelve Zeno’s infinite series exist simultaneously,
the Fractal machine absorbs the entire series as anharmonic
overtone created by the projection of an infinite series from
infinity.
Inductive reasoning and Fractal machine: A comparative view: In a deductive reasoning the conclusion is
an absolute truth, but in inductive reasoning (Rathmanner
and Hutter, 2011) based on evidence the most probable
answer is derived, a little probability exists that it could be
false (Examples of Inductive reasoning are many-valued
logic, Dempster–Shafer theory, or probability theory which
decides following the Bayes’ rule as an example). The effort
lead to a path beyond Turing, namely to a class of efforts
called hypercomputation, Fractal machine is not an effort to

47

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

go beyond Turing, instead, complement it, so it is not hypercomputation. In Fractal tape reasoning, it is a matrix of
truth, the whole concept of “true” and “false” is made irrelevant, both deductive and inductive reasoning is not related
to Fractal tape reasoning. Since probability is not used in
the Fractal tape reasoning, “Hume Fork” criticism is invalid
here (Herms, 1984). Trial and error iteration to perfect a job
(Schubert, 1974) is a concern when the algorithm learning
protocol is not encoded in the fundamentals of machine protocol, as it is done primarily in Fractal machine using usermachine integrated rhythms.
The fractal machine operates on a multifractal tape:
Connecting several Turing tapes is done frequently in the
category Multi-tape Turing Machine. In order to encode
massive parallelism Multitrack Turing machine is proposed
(Sudkamp, 2006). There are plenty of Turing machine equivalents, which are shown to have no more power than the standard Turing machine (e.g., a Wang, B—machine, Register
machine). In general, it is a multifractal network of tapes,
since the number of cells in the tape is not fixed, it might
change every time it is zoomed. In a multifractal system s, the
behavior around anypoint is described by a local power law:
 


s ( x + a ) − s ( x ) ~ a h( x ), the exponent h ( x ) is called singularity
exponent.
Chaos, Reservoir, Cellular Automaton, Fuzzy, Genetic
Algorithm, Neural network and Fractal machine: A comparative analysis: Random cluster of choices in a black box
emulated the dynamics of natural events efficiently, reservoir computing like echo state model (Maass et al., 2002),
and geometry inspired recent works on liquid state model
(Hazan and Manevit, 2012). For 70 years, successful outputs of the multilayered hidden neural networks leading to
deep learning, thenceforth Fuzzy Turing machine (Santos,
1970), Cellular Automaton (Wolfram, 2002) and the works
of Genetic Algorithm, all attempts fall under the purview of
Turing machine, random points are allowed to mimic the precise input-output observation. Analog computing harnesses
randomness for a better search of good points to generate
functions and then returns to Turing. The fractal machine
does not mimic points in input data, instead, symmetries of
Platonic geometries (Forrest, 1971; Preparata, and Shamos,
1985) and their hierarchical network dynamics are accurately
mapped as rhythms. There is no need to search in Fractal
machine, “right rhythms spontaneously reply.”
Super-recursive approaches and the nested recursive
approaches of fractal tape machine, FTM: Recursion
means repeating itself, recursive means a procedure that
invokes the procedure itself, in computing, it is sub-dividing
a problem into subproblems, but it could be top-down or
bottom-up (Shoenfield, 2001). The recursive feature is implemented in the Turing machine, but Super-recursive (Roglic,
2007) approaches need Hypercomputation like an inductive
Turing machine (see above). Sincere efforts thus were made
to advance algorithm to estimate halt, even more intelligently
in Schmidhuber’s generalized Turing machines, yet Gödel’s
incompleteness argument sustains. A program checking
the halting process cannot decide by itself, but the Fractal

machine can because it completes the network with the user/
environment. The fractal machine applies Gödel’s incompleteness to its favor. Regarding unbounded non-determinism, since
Fractal machine uses rhythms that encompass user, environment
and the machine in a single system, a similar resource sharing is observed, but “time” is deterministic, the FTM machine
is always “online.” In a big data FTM finds nested recursive
points and their groups, the recursive feature of the groups,
then consider it as a singular recursive point, the loop repeats
ad infinitum, never halts.

2.9

CREATION OF A NON-ARGUMENT

Arguing illogically would make a sense: But how making
a nonsense argument? Creating a world beyond Turing and
Russel is not easy, the journey to the world of non-arguments
is full of obstacles. One mistake takes one back to the world of
Turing. On the other hand, being non-sense is being random,
with no rules. That again leads nowhere. The other route is the
Fractal tape or frequency fractal universe that we suggested.
If Turing-Russel arguments were binary arguments, time
crystal route is “nested arguments” (Summary in Figure 2.13).
Here are 12 ways of arguing like a stupid that will make
sense how the universe argues and processes information
at all scales:
1. No question is born in the universe without an
answer, they are born together, live together:
Always a question always has its answer in it, no
question could be created without an answer. Say a
question is a triangle and an answer is a square, then
both are played in a single time cycle. If one plays a
triangle, then the square is played out, and if a square
is played then a triangle is automatically played.
Elementary truth cycles self-assembles but never
break apart. There is no true and no false. No distinct
question and no distinct identity of an answer. A pair
of truths makes a cycle i.e., QA doublet or multiplet.
2. A QA doublet is a projection, there is no absolute truth, every truth is decomposed into a set
of new QA couplets: thus, it is a fractal n­ etwork.
There are only two ways the decomposition works.
QA ­doublets have self-similar clocks (IFS) one
inside another. Thus, QA is never a sum or stepby-step output of another set of QA doublets.
Fractal decomposition of arguments is feasible;
however, it does not allow split them into sequential
or parallel instructions.
3. Elementary arguments, hierarchical arguments
are progeny, they are created. The argument is
not the right word: Clocks holding facts have their
plane and several such planes grow spontaneously in
QA host clock. A non-sensical argument is alive and
extremely unpredictable. Unpredictability is not the
sign of randomness. However, a single observation of
nested rhythm could originate from several distinct
time crystals.

48

Nanobrain

FIGURE 2.13 The methodologies for developing a non-argument. An argument is considered an “if-then” statement. However, it is possible to develop a set of statement that is undefined, each element of the argument does not stand on its own, but requires extensive argument
within. When such a journey continues, an argument does not stand on its own. However, an observer could look only two or more layers
within and above an argument. This is called non-argument.

4. No answer or Question is complete, there is always
a question that invalidates the answer, fixing that
to evolve answer is a journey to completeness:
Gödel hinted for incompleteness, never suggested a
route to explore incompleteness. There is no fact, no
true statement, the information is not just numbers.
Just like in a flute a stationary point is generated, in
the dynamic world, we get nodes and anti-nodes due
to interference with a boundary. Similarly, facts are
static points, it is an emergent feature of the time
crystal.
5. Logically circular or circular logic is the unit
of a singular logic to enter inside and go above:
Universal time crystal always bring circular logic
but follow the boundary limit of an observer. Earlier,
logically circular was a matter of shame, but for geometric prime approach, it is a matter of pride, it is the
foundation. A pair of observers noting a fact would
note different things.

6. An infinite number of planes and their arrangement makes a reality sphere or arguments:
Evolution of an argument: Since question-answer
couples always together, every possible solution
is connected to the question contextually. A question could have many answers in different contexts.
All are mapped in a 3D nested time cycle geometry. There are two ways an argument evolves.
First, increasing the length of the flute Second, editing the position or the number of holes in the flute,
global change means to keep the weight between the
arguments same, only change the perimeter of the
time cycle. Second, editing the holes means changing the geometric shape itself.
7. Truth is not a statement, but a geometric shape:
The motif of argument is to make the geometry more
symmetric and integrating the geometries into one
singular geometry at the highest level (Figure 2.2).
Quaternion arguments form a geometric shape

49

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

and a complex pattern of the composition of basic
­geometries grow continuously. The objective is to
make the shape symmetric following the pattern of
primes, PPM.
8. A logical argument requires the angular orientation or location of an observer on the sphere,
i.e., the perspective of an observer sets the truth:
No logical argument could stand-alone, isolated, it
needs support, even though a fractal arrangement
argues that at the top there should be one argument.
However, even that would require at least three perspectives, first one from the arguments below that
makes it, the second one from above or the argument, it constructs with others, and the third one
the perspective of an observer. A QA time crystal does not have an idiom or universal truth, no
assumption, all assumptions are environment and
context-dependent. There is never a truth or a false
statement.
9. “Burst” does not contain any information, but a
“silence” does: Evolution of dynamic and geometric
phase is everything, amplitude, mass, space all is an
illusion, only time is real. Time does not have any
direction, time does not flow, it adjusts relative positions of “bursts” on its surface that’s why the past
present and future like perceptions appear. There are
only “phase” in the universe, dynamic and geometric
phases. It is the philosophical foundation of nonsensical arguments.
10. An expansion of 12 tunes into a raga is the way
to expand an argument: Raga means an active and
silent composition of 12 notes from 23 options. GML
always builds a time crystal of 12 argument cycles
and then expand them. The PPM follows the same
protocol. QA couplet cycles perpetually making it
nearly perfect. Comparing morphogenesis of time
crystals is the route to auto-correct an argument.
11. Morphing with the universal geometries is a
drive for an argument, there are ten ancient
philosophical ways of making an argument in
the non-argumentative world: Every natural
event has a geometric arrangement of argument
and the practice or game of argument is to morph
with nature’s geometrical arrangement of argument. How to form an argument in the world of
nonsensical argument: (1) Negative approach
(Neti-Neti): Start with everything as wrong and
always try to negate everything that is already concluded. (2) On the last time crystal change the
point of an observer or change perspective of an
observer and repeat the cycle. (3) The philosophy
of infinite series e and Pi and Phi regulates how
the integral systems evolve. More one repeats the
quadratic relation between the mechanical, electrical and magnetic resonance, time crystal evolves
closer to the truth. (4) Breathing of Brahma, periodic morphogenesis of time crystal in the form

of argument. (5) Teardrop and ellipsoid fusion,
time crystals with all input information always
have a basin of attractor, like a pole or nucleus.
A pair of poles are created from a ­single-pole, just
like a circle morphs into a sphere. (6) The swastika route of arguments, the outflow of QA clocks
on the host clock reverses the orientation of the
host. (7) The Om route of arguments: Om letter’s geometry suggests three imaginary worlds
with distinct dynamic pathways, and one ­reality
point. Thus, a quaternary tensor is searched.
(8) 1 = 0 = 1...The infinite series suggests, what
that is a point, is nothing and everything at the
same time. Full or completeness and the hollow
are the same things. One could enter and see the
eight types of nested clocks operating simultaneously (8 levels of consciousness, Yogasutra; octonion ­tensor), and 12 ­layers one inside another, as
dodecanion for 12 planes, icosanion for 12 corner points. (9) The argument of Biratapurusa,
Varnasram and Hiranyagarva: Viratapurusha
means life inside a life… an infinite network (we
limit to twelve). Varnasram means four functional
universes (quaternion). Hiranyagarva means burst
from nothing or singularity. Three concepts build
the foundation of the undefined universe. (10)
The argument of Brahman or universal resonance: There should be one and only one, time
­crystal. All sensory inputs, and hierarchical processing would lead to the fusion of time crystals
following the patterns of primes.
12. The universal geometric relationship evolved into
the number system is emergent nonrepeating:
An argument always has one less variable than the
fixed truth or fact. The total number of variable
and truth should compose like the number system
metric. A little change in the most static argument or QA clock generates a ripple effect to all
nested arguments would change simultaneously.
The concept originates from the assumption that
“everything is connected to everything” or “the
universe is a frequency fractal and consciousness
is its music.”
13. Ten limits of nonsense arguments that are
responsible for making sense: (1) One could
enter inside an argument 12 times to generate 12 fundamentally different dimensions.
There are infinite primes, but if one takes more
than 15 primes, it is nearly redundant. If one takes
more than 15 geometric shapes it is redundant.
Eighteen or thirty imaginary worlds would generate very different kinds of time crystal. (2) An
argument is a beating of beats, Beating means
two nearby frequencies start vibrating at a new
frequency which is the difference between the
two. However, for a time crystal, so many clocks
run very closely in the time domain, one may

50

Nanobrain

get crystals of beat frequencies, (3) All integers
do not provide hierarchical groups: Twelve is
important because 2 × 2 × 3 makes the first triangle, similarly 30 = 2 × 3 × 5; 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5,
18 = 2 × 3 × 3. However, not any number can bind
clocks to be used in GML. (4) It is not possible
to frame an argument, projection is approximate.
(5) 1011 truths or pattern of 12 primes (up to 47,
three primes are silent) is the limit of an argument. (6) There is a 64 cell-matrix of the teardrop to ellipsoid transition, this morphogenesis
dominates all other geometric transformations.
(7) Triplet of triplet fractal forms the boundary
for any information content. (8) The phase is the
only variable, or relative position concerning time.
(9) Multinions of arbitrary choices is not possible, one cannot create odd tensor like 3 × 3, 5 × 5
or 11 × 11, so four choices, 2 × 2, 4 × 4, 8 × 8
and 12 × 12 tensors. (10) Primes 2,3,5,7 alone
is enough to generate the symmetries created by
other primes in an approximate solution.

2.10 FIT SUMMARY IN A SINGLE CHART
FIT is a combination of four GML; PPM described in
Chapter 3; Fractal mechanics, FM and Geometric algebra
described in Chapter 4. In the FIT, information means no
dead fact, with an added flavor of significance, but, a geometric structure, which would provide a correlation between
two or more hidden geometric shapes (Figure 2.14, an
exclusive summary). A fact is an event here, it defies logic,
question and answer have no separate identity; no answer
is complete, generation of symmetry following the pattern
of primes is the spontaneous reply, in response to a question, that could even be a question. It is fundamentally a
different scenario; there is no static or defined state in the
elementary information unit. FIT strictly relies on replacing
the Fast Fourier Transform with time crystal analyzer where
we capture much more information that was never captured
in the existing information theories or available technologies. In the fractal information theory (FIT), the information
does not represent the number of symmetries, but how a system jumps from one symmetry to another. These transitions

FIGURE 2.14 All key functionalities of FIT is shown in a single chart.

51

Replacing Turing Tape with a Fractal Tape

could be such that three or more periodic cycles of switching
between symmetries could play simultaneously. Thus, in a
given set of symmetries, an observer would find only the random transitions, a beautiful picture of intricate time relationships would unravel only in the 3D time crystal plots. In the
FIT, all the time cycles run simultaneously and contain hidden clocks which the sensors never captured, using the pattern of primes, PPM, the input information is expanded, the
output is always higher than the input. One can never finish
reading the entire information in a time crystal. The observer
sees it using its clocks, by locking it from a particular direction. Thus, reading or acquiring input is not one-way traffic, but both ways. Thanks to the pattern of primes, PPM, a
questioner already knows the answer, he asks to find only
a fractal seed like the key to rebuild the entire solution.
Fractal mechanics FM is out there to regulate the manifolds
of dodecanion or 11-dimensional dynamics and instead of
writing tons of equations by drawing circles using a pen, is
out there to see the evolution and sense it immediately.
Basics of FIT:
First, the technical details of the geometric shapes
are written on the cycle perimeter of a time cycle.
When the computation is geometric, the input geometry received at the millisecond scale could be sent
to the femtosecond scale and the process could be
completed.
Second, the process of linking discrete geometric
shapes continues until the highest-level, singular
geometry is reached, it means at the top level there
will be only one geometric structure, e.g., a triangle
or a circle. In the astronomically long resonance
chain, a geometric shape, say pentagon could enter
anywhere say it enters in the microsecond time
domain but would expand both ways in the time
scale. The Pentagon would trigger PPM both toward
the seconds time scale and toward the picosecond
time scale in the resonance chain.
Third, earlier, information theory required a physical object to hold memory, a switch acting as a bit
or qubit, however, since the time crystal is an essential requirement for the FIT, here vortex atoms takes
over. Vortex atoms could be made of water ripples
when we drop a stone in the pond, it could be a vortex of light, magnetic flux, ion, molecules, electric
field (ring-shaped electric field travels around an
axon) etc. Materials synthesis of virtual atoms is the
information processing in FIT.
Fourth, in a packet of information, no clock is
isolated, all the cells of a fractal tape hold a data
­represented by a quaternion. It should be noted that a
dinion or single imaginary world explains quantum
information theory. However, for FIT one requires
at least a quaternion; thus, classical and quantum
information theories fail to ­emulate the FIT. From
the sensory input to the final ­decision-making, a

dodecanion structure of data or a dodecanion 11D
time crystal is always preserved.
Fifth, here the time cycles self-assemble to build
a hierarchical network of time crystals, which is a
learning system, i.e., it self-corrects and grows by
itself, even without an input, following the expansion
of a pattern of primes which glues different geometries to the input and there is no end to it. During
growth, PPM finds many geometric arrangements
missing, then it asks outside or evolves to accommodate it.
Sixth, unlike bits or qubits, here in the FIT, there
is no isolated information unit, the units are always
highly interconnected like a fractal to eventually
create a single cell of a fractal tape. It means the
total amount of information is always one timecycle or one clock, since the log of 1 is 0, hence the
total information content of a fractal tape is zero by
Shannon count. Since all clocks are connected by
PPM, count of those symmetries which breaks at a
time in a local PPM network is the quantity of information content.
Seventh, from different directions, the time crystal
is different, and there are infinite possible directions
and the projections would be different. All projections interact with an observer when it sees the information content by becoming a guest or host of the
time crystal and constitute a new pattern as a function of time perpetually.
Eighth, no additional memory concept is there in
FIT, perpetual cyclic rotation is the memory; no
algorithm is required, the learning is spontaneous
and the perception-based projection from infinity
delivers a defined output, else there is no defined
state within a system operating FIT. No collapse is
required, the decision is retrieved without computation, no reduction of choices, no logic gate and no
switch is required, nothing of the existing information theories survives.
Ninth, there is no “real” domain in the fractal tape,
the cell that is under consideration do not contribute
to its value. It is surprising, the cells below create an
imaginary world, the cells above create an imaginary
world and the observer uses own imaginary world to
find the weight of time cycles, the cell that is being
measured contributes nothing when it is estimated,
but of course when the neighbors are estimated, it
contributes.
Ten, the unpredictability is enormous. On a single
fractal tape three observers measuring the cell state
at three different domains simultaneously, would
affect each other’s measurement. However, they
would never detect the error. The measurement of
a single cell in the fractal tape may affect the entire
chain. Most importantly, that ripple effect would
depend on the position of all system points in the
entire clock network at that instant.

Comparison between Fractal machine and the Turing
machine
Fractal turing tape machine: We have defined the
­fractal tape machine (FTM) in the same way Turing machine
is defined. It follows four tuples (i) Information is converted
into nested rhythms or 11D time crystals. (ii) Nested rhythms
are absorbed in the PPM and associative time cycles activate. (iii) PPM emulates the PPM or the questioner and that
spontaneously replies the missing symmetries in the vortex
atom network as the solution; (iv) change the internal circuits
to add the missing pieces of symmetries and thus learning
begins.
The remarkable changes that would happen if an FTM is
widely used in the industry:
1. Multilayered cavity resonator and dielectric resonator networks or multiple “nested clocks” one inside
another enable “a virtual instant decision-making.”
A question asked to a clock that syncs with output is
sent to faster clocks inside, decision delivers before
the slow clock ticks even for once. PPMs of the questioner and the responder melt together.
2. “Nested cavity” keeps the “volume of hardware
intact” as the required resources are poured inside a
vortex generator.
3. “Spontaneous reply” enables “search without
searching.” It relies on the resonance energy transfer, via the time crystal wirelessly hence no wiring
needed, vortex generators should orient in the floating 3D world in particular directions. No logic gate
or circuit is needed, so “zero junction hardware.”
4. The decision-making device uses GML, hence
“nested frequency cycles or time crystals hold
the geometric shape” are necessary information
not bits. A cycle is a memory, rotation is the processing, “no transport needed between memory and
processing units.” Capturing geometric structure of
nature as a time crystal is itself the discovery of hidden intelligence of a complex event, that is itself the
discovery of a new physical phenomenon, data capture means learning and completion of analysis.
5. Reduction of choices or logic gate is replaced by
“spontaneous activation of many paths,” ability to
“perception capture” by acquiring projection from
infinity, it means how does the complex geometric
shape evolution look like in the infinity is taken back
as reality. Since there is no reality, everything is
made of singularity, the reality is generated by
expanding and projecting the shapes to the infinity and acquiring the feedback geometry as the
reality.
6. “Perpetual spontaneous editing of slower cycles”
(creation/destruction/defragmentation) “prepare for
unknown” = higher-level learning is achieved by the
pattern of primes, which continually tries to increase

its operational bandwidth, causing the birth of slower
and slower cycles.
7. “No programming required” as “cycles selfassemble/dis-assembly for better sync at all possible time scales simultaneously” by following the
PPM this is not astrophysics like singular metric, but
a composition of several matrices, at least ten different classes are out there (Chapter 3).
8. “Halting concern irrelevant” as “looping nested
rhythms of input and memory drives computation,” as soon as the time-cycle forms a closed loop,
the expansion and feed-forward sync/de-sync drive
halts naturally as every cycle completes and the projection from infinity or feedback is sent out.
9. “Nested decoding of sensory signals” protocol
“captures and preserves hidden dynamics of a
phenomenon,” so we do not have to formulate theories, its purity is preserved in an all-analog process.
Since dodecanion is an 11D dynamics hunter it
while embedded in the PPM perfects a phenomenon,
99.99% accuracy.
10. “Equal diameter cycles assemble into a sphere”
enables the estimation of simultaneously operating
a million paths “extreme parallelism.” In quantum, measurement disrupts, decreases computing speed, here that cannot, there is no chance of
entanglement breaking because unlike quantum
here PPM drives breaking and regeneration of
symmetries in a network where the information
processing is carried out. In quantum breaking
entanglement destroys all leverage over classical,
here, breaking symmetry is the only route of information processing.
11. “Every component is life-like,” as the “geometry
encoded in a cycle changes the hardware.” If one
asks where is the PPM located, it is located everywhere in the computer, from the sensor to transporter
to the single fourth-circuit element Hinductor H,
every single device is programmed to operate a PPM
with a dodecanion, so, all must be lifelike.
12. Construction and energy transmission in the hardware follows ordered factor metric or PPM made
fractal tape that operates by fractal mechanics (FM).
It is “beyond quantum computing” realized by a
“non-differential tape/machine enables multiple
imaginary worlds to play together.”
13. Existing sensory resolution is “high” or “low,” but
FTM introduces “fractal resolution,” a complex
signal’s lowest and fastest time scale signals are
absorbed simultaneously. During the expansion of
a time crystal the fractal seed delivers output with
an unprecedented resolution. It just depends whether
the observer can sense or not.
14. For the decision-making, no energy is required,
instead it executes “noise harvesting,” due to the
nested cavity structure with resonance chain, each
layer absorbs its associated energy naturally from the

environment apart from intentionally initiated communication. Noise is required for e − π − φ magnetoelectric-mechanical triad to operate, that is a key to
running a Hinductor H, the fundamental time crystal
synthesizer explored in this book.
15. “Question re-born memory”: Geometry of nested
cavity is such that any few sets of frequency as
query triggers the same rhythm reproducibly,
hence, holding memory does not require a power
supply.

2.11 GML SUMMARY IN A SINGLE CHART
Many-body theorem and the conventional s­ cientific culture to make theory: In all physical theories at a time, only
two particles exist in the universe, then using many-body
theorems we combine several such pairs and construct the
“scientific representation” of the actual universe. Physicists
understand that the journey of “many-body theories” is
never-ending, adding better and more efficient functions in
the energy expression that fits the natural phenomenon better
than its previous version is not an absolute path. The “completeness” concept originates from the argument that all

material properties are encoded inside the matter at a particular time scale. Boundary makes it complete. This book
on dodecanion driven PPM machines or FTM machines is a
journey that compiles the research works that explored the
roles of agents beyond the boundary. A quantum description of the universe is incomplete (Bohr, 1935), considering
directly that everything in the universe (Wheeler, 1967) is
due to changing geometric shape does not work either in
quantum mechanics (Wheeler, 1957). Once programmed,
circuit built, quantum computation takes no time. For example, in case of pattern search algorithm (say a pattern search
in the Clique problem), with the increase of search space,
the search time does not decrease much compared to a classical computer. The reason is straightforward: perpetual
entanglement does not allow rejection and selection of an
astronomically large number of paths, without losing time.
Thus, every time entanglement is broken, the time is lost,
the overall speed in quantum computing goes down significantly, though entangled states collapse in no time. GML
does not require breaking entanglement if one builds a
quantum computer using this language, but the pattern of
primes (PPM, Chapter 3) should drive the hardware, see
Figures 2.14 and 2.15.

2.12 CONCLUSION: RUSSEL’S PARADOX
AND HIGHER-ORDER LOGIC IN
A GEOMETRIC LANGUAGE
Higher-order logic in the layered 12 nested ­universes: the
language of primes: In the last ­century 1905–1937, the syntax of arguments came into being. The culture expanded from
the fact that any sequence of events could be split as the sum
of the elementary, isolated, discrete sum of events, which are
results of logical queries either true or false (predicate logic).
Thus, we introduced the sign “equals” to relate input and output (Church’s λ calculus, Kleen’s recursive function theory or
computability theory, recursive = computable etc.). Darwin’s
definition of evolution where he argued descent with modification is an effort to endless journey to perfection. Water leaks,
but how could get a logic leak: The secret of the universal
computing concept lies in the philosophy of Turing, where he
described brilliantly that the world of information and event is
represented as a grid (a piece of paper) made of cells containing discrete events. If we consider a leak in the isolated cells
of the grid, the entire adventure of 100 years old computing
will fall apart, isolation, pristine identity that gives completeness. All previous attempts to go beyond the Turing kept the
grid intact and yet tried to find ways to draw multiple paths
between a pair of facts, thus, converted into a Turing machine
eventually. A fractal tape only one cell in the grid, but if we
enter in that cell we get millions of grids, select and enter
inside, then it would open up another grid, and the journey
continues, then the concept of first-order logic would not be
the answer of a query, “true or false,” preferably a 3D network of truth. In the Turing world, we can write many FOLs
using a pen on a piece of paper, torn each piece of paper and
arrange them in a line (Turing machine). However, in the new
world of FIT, we sit with a piece of paper forever, several new
papers exist, but invisible to each other, they grow within and
above, each paper has no idea that due to their composition
new papers are taking birth. Thus, logic leaks, or nonsense,
illogical decisions govern. Turing machine where the solution
is restricted to the instructions written in the tape, in fractal
tape, it is not. There is no previous and the next step, unlike
Marvin machine, every state is a solution to the problem, the
solution is delivered perpetually. The system is interactive
like a “reactive system,” response to the environment, but
as part of the environment, instead of the state transition

diagram FTM has a set of PPMs, which is a highly connected 3D network of time crystals and evolves in a lifelike
manner.
Russel’s paradox and the magic of time crystals: One
of the most beautiful parts of a single, unified time crystal
extended from the smallest spatial dimension to the large,
covered with clocks of the shortest time domain to the longest
is that only 15 geometric shapes with 15 primes can sing it
99.99% accuracy. Humans sense 4D, some other sensors could
read 11D, but the pattern of primes reaches saturation above
1012 clocks, then it begins counting in a new way, so, the properties of the properties is a set to it. The argument that the universe is a frequency fractal of primes and the consciousness
is its music is an excellent example of Russel’s paradox where
the properties of properties become an element of the set in
its core, hence, the set theorem cannot explain the situation.
Now, since Russel’s paradox sets in, all higher-order logic
cannot be transformed into a second-order logic. In such systems, a set of oscillators decides the order of logic and if it is
said 5, then all five orders of logic operate independently and
co-operatively in a single system. Of course, we can determine from the coupling map which clock would trigger which
order logic. These time crystals cannot be transformed into a
set of a linear sequence of clocks.
Processing higher-order time crystals or network of
events: First-order logic is about the strict factual statement;
here it is the coupling between the symmetries within a given
imaginary world. Note that all 12 worlds are imaginary, the
one that communicates with the external worlds acquires the
state of a real world. When the interactive imaginary worlds
have a similar local domain of clocks, this is a property of the
higher-order coupling and thus, fundamentally different from
the “direct coupling” that happens within an imaginary world.
Quaternary, tensors hold the second-order logic, which is
more potent than “direct coupling” induced first-order logic.
Octonion tensors generate duality when we see the tensor as
a composition of quaternions in the Figure 4.13, it is a thirdorder logic; while the dodecanion tensor holds a triangular
composition of quaternions in the same figure, hence it is the
fourth-order logic. The hierarchy of logic is an oxymoron,
because in a circular loop, there could never be an “if-then”
statement, still, when the projection comes from infinity, be it
an illusion, not a mathematical perfection but a PPM driven
hardware would tag it as a “reality.”

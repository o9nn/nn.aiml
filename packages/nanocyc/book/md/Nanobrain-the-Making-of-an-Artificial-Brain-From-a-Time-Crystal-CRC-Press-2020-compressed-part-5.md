Only that person comes to learn universal consciousness, to whom the universal consciousness wants to unfold in an
unexpressive manner; however, that person, to whom it comes as a subject of knowledge, cannot state what it is. Those
who have seen and felt it could never be consciously aware that they have realized it, but those who think that they have
felt it have never learned what it is.

Mechanics Is Not Quantum

but Original—Geometric Algebra
for a Dodecanion Brain
4.1 REVISITING THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF
QUANTUM MECHANICS USING CLOCKS
If today, geometric musical language (GML) is the language of the universe, then: “Tomorrow we will have learned
to understand and express all of physics in the language of
information” (Wheeler, 1990). If one has understood the right
information theory of the universe would be, “at that point
ready to revalue h = 2.612 × 10~66 cm2—as we downgrade
c = 3 × 1010 cm/s today—from constant of nature to an artifact of history, and from the foundation of truth to the enemy
of understanding.” The quest for a unified language for physics and mathematics is long (Hestenes, 1986). The message is
clear. Explain the origin of fundamental constants, learn what
existence is. Only acceptable proof that the true language of
nature is invented, is the derivation of all fundamental constants from “no law.” He envisioned “the world as system selfsynthesized by quantum networking” (Wheeler, 1988). When
there are plenty of observers, how the information structure
changes? It is said that every measurement changes the source.
It is very exciting. The photon that started from a distant star
Billions of years back, when we measure it in the planet earth,
by looking at that star, in our naked eye, the atoms in our eyes
collapse the state, the entangled photon may be traveling to a
very different direction, finds its state fixed. Across cosmos,
zillions of atoms which are observing a single star would even
change the star (Super Copernicus principle).
Nanobrain is a nano-sized black hole: Wonderful
entropy of Bekenstein: We revisit quantum mechanics by
writing all its basic knowledge gathered and optimized in the
last century in terms of geometric musical language (GML)
developed recently. We find that the basic unit of information, a clocking Bloch sphere holding a geometric shape that
we introduced in the second chapter, could pictorially present all derivations of quantum mechanics. We have not tried

to derive quantum mechanics, we consider it a phenomenon
that has only one ­property, “collect the singularity points
and clock them in a single circle” (Wheeler, 1968; Hartle,
2005; Hawking, 1982; Vilenkin, 1982). The singular property
is essential and a sufficient condition to generate a wavefunction (Hartle and Hawking, 1983), thus, all of the quantum
using GML. See how measurement is a fusion of two clocks in
Figure 4.1a. In fact, the very foundation of GML is quantum,
with a difference that its Bloch sphere has no classical point.
The interesting feature of a self-assembled Bloch sphere is
that apart from being a time crystal, the whole information
architecture, whether it represents a human brain or a single
protein molecule, it is similar to a nano black hole. Its only
constituent is singularity points. Bekenstein found that the
surface area of the horizon of a black hole, rotating or not,
measures the entropy of the black hole, it is 2.77 times the
plank area (Bekenstein, 1973, 1980; Penrose, 1969). A composite time crystal representing the information architecture
of a complex system is filled with clocking singularity points,
hence the surface geometry of silence accounts for an entropy.
We do not need to count the Bekenstein number. The complex surface area of a time crystal is proportional to its
entropy. Since we use fourth-circuit element, Hinductor for
implementing phase prime metric (PPM) and the GML, which
increases magnetic flux linearly as a function of charge, such
a scenario is valid even for a charged black hole (Zurek and
Thome, 1985). It was argued that to address the complexity of
the level of universe or brain we need an information metric
(Zurek, 1989), we have it now as PPM, that does not grow or
lose its complexity remains fixed everywhere.
Feynman’s singularity bridge (Cao et al., 1993; Feynman,
1949): The worldview breaks the fundamentals of the information science that has been successful for over a century.
The reasons are the following. First, the observer dilemma is
that already it is putting its bias into the system by choosing

85

86

when to see, wherefrom to see, how much to see in the output.
Then, the observer should not make a black box to fit nature
blindly. Second, quantum fails to probe singularity. When
one considers events inside an event inside an event in an
infinite network, then it takes us back to the deadlock of the
1930s. Then, Feynman bypassed the singularity to save the
quantum deadlock (Reddy et al., 2018). Bridging singularity
saved them. However, the journey they avoided is what makes
nature beautiful. One should not bypass but explore it (Mallat
and Hwang, 1992). Third, logic and the fitting tools of Al are
blamed for being a product of human imagination for creating the abstract black box. It is far beyond reality, only to fit
certain observations. Then, one should not avoid singularity,
do not use an “educated guess.”
It is the purity of time that demands a new mechanics:
Time travels both ways in quantum, to the past and to the
future, just like all other physics laws, so the quantum is natural. However, the classical world where time travels in one
direction is shocking, surprising (Price, 1996). In classical
wisdom, time does not divide like cells, it does not intersect
with another flow of time, it does not return or suddenly die
out, or disappear forever. Time has no beginning or end, be it
flows linearly or in a circle (time asymmetry). Here we envision a world where time is an architecture of phase following
the symmetry of primes. Quantum is its local view, classical
is a point on this structure. On a circle where the phase is
changing 0°–360°, on its perimeter a pixel cannot be a complete event, as no event is before itself, else “the world recurs
infinitely many times” (eternal recurrence; Nietzsche, 1967).
Thus, we sense the need for new mechanics. Even quantum
has evolved so much. Earlier it was proposed that multiple
classical worlds interact in parallel to create a quantum world
(Poirier, 2010), and now it is more clearly argued that all classical world’s work deterministically, since we are ignorant
about their motion, we see the unpredictability (Hall et al.,
2014). Ehrenfest’s theorem, wave packet spreading, barrier
tunneling, and zero-point energy have been mathematically
created using repulsions among these deterministic classical
worlds. The journey between classical to quantum and quantum to classical has seen many adventures, but the journey
through imaginary worlds remained unhonored.
A journey from qudit to fractal mechanics: an undefined network of actions hc (Plank constant × velocity of
light): We consider quantum mechanics as a fundamental
property of the universe that couples the vibrational systems
in the time domain, independent of space, the connection is
made by a wave function. Two particles at the extreme ends of
the universes could be part of a single wave function. Quantum
mechanics is said to be incomplete; a wave function should
include an observer (Wheeler, 1977), but if there are classical
points on the Bloch sphere, this won’t be possible. As outlined
in Figure 4.1a, an observer could be a pixel of the object to
be observed or vice versa, when clocks depict wave–particle
duality (pixel or perimeter that’s the uncertainty), the relative
size of clocks would matter. If the worldview is sequential,
then one imaginary world of quantum mechanics is enough.
However, when we explore “within and above” assembly of

Nanobrain

events, a large number of imaginary worlds would coexist.
Thus far, quantum mechanics used octonions only to define
multi-dimensional dynamics of one imaginary world, never
explored, how multiple imaginary world could coexist. That
takes us to a new mechanics, namely fractal mechanics (FM).
Ten principles of fractal mechanics: Thus far several
attempts were made to put multiple classical points on the surface of a Bloch sphere. The attempt curves the Bloch sphere
and we need to go to a higher dimension. Instead, when we
built the foundation of GML (Chapter 2), we inserted new
Bloch spheres at the singularity points. Instead of Bloch sphere
we use the term phase sphere, because no real point exists
on the Bloch sphere. The particular step drastically reduces
the computational complexity for theoretically estimating
the efficiency of the information architecture. Moreover, the
mechanics driven by bursts from singularity alone requires
multiple changes as outlined below:
1. We do not need to go to a higher dimension, 3D representation of phase spheres is sufficient to process
higher dynamics. One can enter inside the singularity points 10 or 11 times, as soon as a system point
crosses 10 layers or singularity points one inside
another, in reality the complexity of 10 dimensions
is addressed.
2.  maps the horizon area as information lost, it reveals
the wave number of light as photon momentum and
considers field flux similar to a bit-registered fringe
shift. Therefore, GML derived time crystals that
we built for operating the fourth-circuit elements
(Chapter 8), we get momentum as typical geometric
features of time crystal at various layers. In the conventional quantum mechanics, one layer or one imaginary universe is enough. Here at each layer, we get
a set of momentum space made of layers below and
contributes to defining the momentum above. When
we rewrite basic quantum interference and quantum
beating in terms of nested clocks or circles, we see
the need for at least two nested imaginary layers
(Figure 4.1b).
3. Product of plank constant and velocity is defined as
action ( =
A hc
= hv ). In the conventional quantum
mechanics action is always hc, here in some layers it is
hc and somewhere it is hv( v = velocity). Most importantly, hc is the flux of the most fundamental ring, it is
magnetic. Information architecture is now an infinite
network of various kinds of actions that is undefined
everywhere. Projection of an observer’s time crystal
on the measuring time crystal to the infinity reflects
back to the observer. The feedback from infinity on the
observer is the reality. For this reason, we cannot even
use the term classical-like or quantum-like. Of course,
an entangled quantum system or free-to-edit classical
system are both not essential to operate a PPM.
4. Bell’s theorem is a proposal to measure the action at
a distance; it is a bridge between the special theory of
relativity and quantum mechanics. For entanglement

87

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

we need a hidden variable common to both the systems (Bohm, 1952). When we introduce PPM, there
is a composition of symmetries linking observer and
the system to be observed doing the measurement,
the system and the environment are connected by
clocks. Thus, it is not just one but an intricate map
of geometric variables acting on the measurement.
Therefore, a measurement following fractal mechanics would deliver a set of observations, not one, one
just requires proper sensors to sense them in a nondemolition manner.
5. There is no collapse of the wave function by measurement, it is a redistribution of the clocks, restructuring

the topology of symmetries that link two spatially
distant, temporally non-separated systems. It is
nearly impossible to destroy or delink all clocks,
a measurement acts only on a few clocks. A clock
forms when a phase loop traps a clock smaller than
its pixel, then a new pixel is born in the host clock’s
perimeter. The creation of a system point is adding a
pixel with a physical identity (Figure 4.1c).
6. Fractal mechanics is based on three fundamentals,
singularity, the multi-layered architecture of clocks
and the symmetry of primes. The architecture of
clocks is similar to a generalized version of time

FIGURE 4.1 Using geometric musical language (GML) we revisit quantum mechanics. (a) No wave flows without a counter. Using a circle
and a dot the philosophy of quantum mechanics is explained. The observer could be a dot, a circle or even bigger than the host. When a circle
or a clock is measured it is a particle and when observed it is a wave. (b) Quantum interference and quantum beating shown with circles as

crystals, not a single clock with a single singularity
points as advocated by Winfree or Wilczek.
7. Fractal mechanics do not have “A causes B,” no one
observes independently, no one measures as an outside system, no collapse is ever complete (Dummett,
1954). Triangular systems, the observer, measuring
system and the environment are part of a single network of phase or architecture of clocks that has guidance following PPM.
8. The origin of unpredictability in the universe is one
and only one source, the number of primes required to
cover 100% of all possible composition of symmetries
is not fixed. It is the reason, some systems reach saturation at 12 number of primes, some at 13, some at 14.
A system could decide to stop at 99%, or 99.99% or
99.99999%, above first 12 primes, a system could stop
anywhere. It stops constructing a pure mathematical
universe or artificial brain or a self-operational system, then starts growing again, from a single unit.
9. No need to save locality in the future and in the past.
No need to artificially link causal asymmetry with
the physical asymmetry, the map is part of “advanced
action” (Price, 1996) embedded in PPM.
10. In quantum, no one dares to picturize the origin of
quantization, coherence and entanglement. In fractal
mechanics, the smallest pixel that makes a circle or
loop perimeter is a natural choice for quantization
(Figure 4.1d). Distance between two pixels is inevitable. Geometric similarity, rotational directional
similarity and a similarity in the arrangement of
clocks determine the fractal coherence (Figure 4.1e).
A fractal coherence means a map of coherent systems
spread over several imaginary worlds. Since quantum
has only one, such maps are non-existent. Fractal
mechanics could explore the architecture of clocks
in the superposed Hilbert space of quantum mechanics (Figure 4.1f). Since all clocks are connected,
fractal harmonic oscillators show a complex hierarchical pattern of resonance peaks (Figure 4.1g), and
retrieves the entanglement like responses since, it is
all about rebuilding the missing clock (Figure 4.1h).

4.1.1 Wave–Particle Duality, Beating, Interference,
Entanglement, and Harmonic Oscillator
The birth of a system point: In GML, every event is a clock
with a few singularity points constituting a geometric shape,
and a singularity point or a pixel often has a topology inside.
When all the singularity points in the internal topology of
the guest clocks synchronize to activate an entire loop at
a time, effectively it becomes a single system point for the
higher topology and could move along the higher topological structure, i.e., available above. Thus, a system point is
born at the event point (Figure 4.1c). Energy burst from a
singularity is how a system operating GML carries out a
conversation.

Nanobrain

Measuring and editing a time crystal: Pump-probe experiments work on an internally linear structure, for a time crystal,
we need a similar structure to sync with the time crystal that we
want to measure and in return let the singularity points bursts
signals. It would be a non-demolition type measurement where
we try to change probing time crystal continuously keeping
both measuring and to be measured time crystals side by side
until there is a match. As soon as they match two types of
signals emit. The first stream of waveforms of different frequencies with changing phase values and the second stream of
complex waveforms where different waves are fused together.
We have studied a large number of proteins and their complexes
and these two types of signals generate continuously, from
which we identified the time crystal. Measurement is morphing between two geometries whose corner points are made of
singularities. Time of measurement is the time of the slowest
clock, not linear. So, in a time crystal computer the computing
time is fixed by the slowest clock in operation. During measurement, can we sync with a part of time crystal? We can
if the part’s complexity has reached beyond a certain level. If
12 or more clocking units are there we get 2 × 2 × 3, 2 × 3 × 2,
3 × 2 × 2, three points that generate a higher-level topology.
Now, there are integers for which we may get geometric shapes
and in the corner of the geometric shapes we get new structures within. When geometric structures seeded within corners
they are separately measurable. By bringing a time crystal of
similar symmetry composition we can measure the time crystal. But still there is no gradual synchronization. We have to
redefine our concept on the gradual sync, it’s either the whole
part at once, or no interaction at all, time is fractal here. It is
morphing between two geometries.

4.1.2 Multiple Imaginary Worlds Operating
at a Time Need Fractal Mechanics
When a person moves around a circular path, after reaching
the starting point, no evidence is retained anywhere that he
rotated along the circular path at all. It is a classical view,
how could we describe motion or dynamics in the quantum
world? Pancharatnam came up with an idea of an infinite
cylinder, where one sees the cylinder classically along the
length, only the circle is visible, classically, but for quantum,
one sees from the side, the moving point follows a spiral path,
each rotation acquires a geometric phase. When we move to
multilayered imaginary universes, the first major change in
the Pancharatnam’s idea would be twisting the cylinder into
a cylinder shape (Pancharatnam, 1956). If we have clocks in
the geometric phase of quantum, or the first imaginary world,
then it would be sufficient to roll the Pancharatnam’s cylinder into a circle, but then we would have the same problem
that Pancharatnam had with quantum mechanics. How do we
measure the phase change for the second imaginary world,
beyond quantum. So, we twist the cylinder into a spiral form,
get a higher-level infinite cylinder for the second imaginary
world. The journey continues here, for 11 times, we say spiral
of the spiral of a spiral….11 times, it’s a cylinder made of

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

a spiral made of a cylinder made of a spiral…. So, fractal
mechanics is the mechanics of interactive imaginary layers,
that interaction is not random, governed by multinion tensors,
in the real physical space, minor changes would dramatically
change the phase space.

4.2 FRACTAL MECHANICS ACTS IN THE PHASE
SPACE CONNECTING SINGULARITY POINTS
Ten foundations of the Fractal mechanics (FM)
1. Any point in space is a superposition of at least
three imaginary “time” worlds forming a time
crystal while there is only one imaginary world in
QM. Supplement to a fractal state is contextual or
non-contextual, if contextual then what would be
its nature is decided by observer’s coupling with
the three or more imaginary time cycles. Here, the
study is limited to 12 imaginary worlds (dodecanion
or icosanion).
2. Time gets a complex composition of rotations or
spins as soon as information is encoded and that
direction is purely based on the 3 to 12 imaginary
worlds. The 3D orientation of three or more imaginary time cycle planes changes with time, as information exchange between time crystals. Sometimes
exchange means bonding or breaking of time cycles,
often it changes the relative orientation of the planes.
Hence, the same system is measured differently
by a different observer, differently by the same
observer from different directions. Measurement is
a match between common nested cycles between
the observer and that of the two imaginary worlds,
the matched nested cycles create a domain on
the phase space which is the “reality sphere.”
Oscillation of unit time means a change in the
diameters of the local guest time cycles embedded
sequentially in the singularity domains of the host
giant time cycle.
3. Ten fundamental properties of wave function
in Fractal mechanics (FM) that differs than the
quantum mechanics: Wave function ψ is a time
crystal or a deconstructed topological architecture
in the Fractal mechanics (FM), while it is the fundamental unit in quantum mechanics: (i) ψ is not a wave
function, in FM it is a projection P of the imaginary
triplet worlds of the observed on the imaginary triplet world of an observer (we call it “reality sphere”;
∅ is a point on this sphere). Note that we described
in Chapter 2 that be it a quaternion, or octonion,
or dodecanion tensor, all could be represented by a
quaternion, wave function in FM is a tensor product
Ж of the observer, observed and the environment.
In other words, ∅ = P{ f ( z1 ) + f ( z2 ) + f ( z3 )}. (ii)
Probability does not exist, ∅ 2 takes a few common
clock based architecture or time crystals of the

imaginary part of the wave function and returns to
a real entity in QM, we cannot do this in FM here
∅∅* = ∑i f ( zi ) f ( zi *). (iii) The wave function {∅}
does not have a stationary state, the observed value
is a set of output crystals by Ж operation which is
a function of time. The “singularities” containing
time crystals on the “reality sphere” changes with
the observers time crystal. (iv) The wave function
{∅} does not require additional normalization or
renormalization as the projection of a structured
system’s charge and mass, i.e., all divergent parameters are always finite, w.r.t. observer. (v) The wave
function {∅} grows and does not remain as an isolated packet, edit cycles phase to make a virtual
sphere/hyperboloid unlike QM, hence, not only
Fractal mechanics (FM) details the skeleton of {∅},
it maps {∅}’s evolution. (vi) The wave function {∅}
self-assembles following ordered factor metric or
prime number symmetry in the number system, i.e.,
there is a universal frequency chain or resonance
chain that governs self-assembly. (vii) Bra-ket algebra does not work here, continued fraction algebra
that processes infinite series in the finite domain
is applicable, the mathematical operator Ж works
here, we would detail this operator in the Chapter,
a bit later. (viii) The wave function {∅} is a multinion tensor follows an unique multinion algebra,
but normally we think tensor means a spatial direction, here it is a temporal direction, imagine 11D
orientation of clocks in a manifold. (ix) The wave
function {∅} is mass and length independent,
no distinction, hence, it can hold infinite mass or
length to the smallest mass or distance possible.
Thus, the observer decides the magnitudes of the
observed. (x) The wave function {∅} holds information as geometric distribution of frequencies in the
time crystal.
4. Zero-point energy and minima of QHO does
not arise: Quantum field theory (QFT) suggests
that every point in a vacuum is quantum harmonic
oscillator (QHO), so every point has finite energy,
providing zero-point energy. For fractal mechanics
(FM), every point is a fractal harmonic oscillator,
due to fractal nature there is no limit, and minimum
energy for FM is determined by observer unlike
QM or QFT. If we resolve the energy minima, we
get something else, a composition of time crystals
within. As a result as empty space is an infinite volume fractal, mathematically undefined and is truly
a superposition of fluctuating oscillator network.
5. Ten basic principles of Fractal mechanics (FM)
are: (a) Quantum superposition is simple addition
of wave functions, ψ = c1ψ 1 + c2ψ 2 + ... however
in fractal mechanics (FM) there is no addition or subtraction or division or multiplication. Those are the
entities of sequential world. All wave functions that

89

90

Nanobrain

superimpose are connected by nested cycles, its projection, f(z) = Sum f(zi), which is regulated by multinion algebra and Ж operator, product is not sum of
wave function. Superposition is different at different
location of the nested cycle structure, or time crystal. (b) Entanglement in QM is a definite operation,
if one entity is changed the other entangled entity
changes to a given state. For FM, two entangled
objects are part of a single cycle or multiple cycles.
Therefore, the output of measurement could deliver
more than one values at a time, and or as a function
of time, not just one. (c) The elementary composition of an observer has defined QM observer’s treatment has a long history of algebraic, contextuality,
etc., it is debated, FM does deconstruct observer with
strictly defined rules. (d) Measurement in QM gives
a probability distribution of values, in FM a measurement gives a time crystal, ψ is always an output of
a measurement which is observer and environmentdependent. The ψ does not exist without measurement, since there is no projection, a projection from
infinity is required for the existence. (e) The measurement complexity: In FM ψ is {∅}, a time crystal, looks different from a different direction. For a
single observer, a 3D measurement around ψ creates
a time crystal architecture of measurement this is
the projected matrix. Since two identical observers
observing the same ψ simultaneously cannot occupy
the same position hence would measure different
parts of the observed entity, or fractional part of a
time crystal. The output cannot be taken from one
sphere of a time crystal because two observers will
influence each other, hence a new combined time
crystal needs to be created. (f) Variable system
points: Since variable system points are included in
the nested cycles, how many system points need to
be considered depends on the observer’s nested cycle
too (D2<<D1, as explained above). (g) Fractal harmonic oscillator: unlike QM where the quantum
harmonic oscillator is used, the fractal harmonic
oscillator is not singular entity. Here an oscillator is
made of another kind of oscillator inside and is itself
a guest inside a host oscillator above. (h) Twelve,
instead of one imaginary world: In QM, the state of
a system is undefined, its burst on a circle perimeter
of a sphere or time crystal. In FM, multiple imaginary
axes orthogonal to each other builds 11D architecture
of ψ . (i) Infinite resolution is achieved comprehensively: QM can have a fractal clock in one imaginary
world, even in 11D dynamics. Here, in FM the wave
functions have infinite resolution that cascades through
11 imaginary worlds one inside another. (j) Treating
mass and space separately: In QM, mass is a matter
wave, similar to a wave function but still mass is used
in the Schrödinger equation as a distinct entity. Fractal
space-time tried to resolve this configuration by considering mass = a 12 clock based nested rhythm or

time crystal with a particular topology. Since FM considers time as a singular variable in its metric, space to
be replaced by phase governing evolution of time, here
mass = unresolved nested cycles made of frequencies
when an observer interacts with a high density nested
cycles. Thus, FM’s version of Schrödinger’s equation could have a time crystal for mass. Entanglement,
duality and superposition are peculiarities of three
nested imaginary worlds in FM. Entanglement primarily originates in the imaginary world above,
the wave–particle duality comes from the world
present and within, Superposition originates in the
imaginary world below, and collapse does not occur,
there is no reduction, only one event happens, that is
synchronization and de-synchronization of nested time
cycles between the three imaginary worlds.
6. Time-based dimensional analysis unravels a
unique physical picture: What is space? What is
mass? What is the time?: In FM it is considered
M = L = T, mass = length = time = phase, all three
parameters are represented as time crystal, distinct
architecture of phase. All parameters in the universe
should have dimensions, related to, phase alone,
if one converts to time then 1/T 4, 1/T 3, 1/T 2, 1/T, 1,
T, T 2, T 3, T 4…. Since mass and length or space are
nested time cycles, hence, every single fundamental
constant and all parameters turn to the power of T or
phase. The power of time dimension determines the
weight of a parameter, Plank’s constant is T 2, velocity
is 0, etc., the infinite series is converted into nested
cycles. It is interesting because from a time cycle, we
can get 2π R = h (h = Plank’s constant), h should be
the smallest distance, and a series of existing scientific dimension now gets a geometric perspective.
7. Equivalence principle changes fundamentally:
now all parameters and fundamental constants
turn geometric: Time is a cyclic motion of phase.
The unresolved energy packet with the simultaneous
coexistence of all points on the loop perimeter, when
an observer resolves the energy packet it detects the
change in phase or time. Stereographic projection of
the imaginary planes deliver several fundamental constants. The simultaneous phase change decreases to
velocity c when two cycles assemble one perpendicular to another making a sphere, as π decreases due to
a nonlinear surface (then we get π = C, the velocity of
light). Note that the value of π is changed on a Euclidean
surface (π increases due to nonlinearity then we get
2 π ~ h, G, Avogadro). Josephson constant ∼ 3/ 2π
; Mu ∼ 4π ; F ( faraday, or electron mass ) ∼ 3π ,
Vk = 8π (von Klitzing constant), π / 2 ∼ e (an
electronic charge, atomic mass constant),
π /4 = Cosmological constant (dimension 1/L2, for
the fractal information processing 1/T 2, =energy density of vacuum). It seems all fundamental constants
originate from e, π, and ϕ (Golden ratio) due to
the non-linear surface or Euclidian geometry, they

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

change due to the topological constraints of different embedded imaginary worlds (we neglect the
order or power). The hyperbolic surface has π > 3.14
and the spherical surface has π < 3.14; there are multiple geometric spaces across the imaginary manifolds
of 11D on which the physical constants get created.
On a sphere, some sets of from e, π, and ϕ values are
stereographically projected on a hyperbolic surface.
Hence, the geometric shape that nested cycles want
to create is not just a sphere rather a 3D dual conical shape, sometimes it’s a sphere and sometimes
it’s a hyperboloid. Why π values form manifold/
fraction in an integral way, who quantizes the constants? The answer is the number of loops allowed in
the ordered factor metric. There is no space, a nested
time cycle has upper and lower detection resolution,
the lower resolution creates the boundary of a particle
and beyond the upper resolution it’s an open space.
Mass comes from the transition of elliptic to ellipsoid
cavity resonator rhythms, nested cycle rotation is felt
like gravity, so there is no need to consider a separate
mass, a typical 12 clock structure based time crystal is
sufficient to represent mass. Momentum is a property
that varies with the square of the time-lapse in a system, it means a time crystal is sufficient to represent
momentum. The Kinetic, Potential and total energy is
simply “time.” In QM an operator executes a defined
transformation, gives the expectation values, in FM
we have a protocol. The observer’s time cycle continuously checks the tape’s cells and integrates, disintegrates (clocking together or in an isolated manner) the
nested time cycle and that is synced with the observer.
This continues time and again to deliver different
physical parameters that govern a system.
8. Implications of the fractal clock: Fusion of special relativity, general relativity and Quantum
mechanics: The fusion is not new, it has been realized with fractal clocks for over a decade now:
G. N. Ord, Laurent Nottale, and M. L. Naschie
are a few among recent proponents of fractal time.
The strongest and direct argument for such a fractal clock universe has been put forth by Ord (1983,
2011, 2012). Already G. N. Ord showed in a fractal
clock system special relativity emerges at different continuum limit. Since FM takes out the mass
from the equations, it is possible to estimate the
laws of gravitation from the nested cycles simply by
using the ordered factor metric (teardrop to ellipsoid transition in ordered factor metric delivers the
laws of gravitation) one might connect both quantum mechanics and the general theory of relativity.
There is no velocity, no distance, only phase that we
have to change in the time cycle, not in the distance
parameter to generate cause-effect. Since distance
does not exist in reality, it is a particular topological
feature of a time crystal, the extreme velocity c and
entanglement induced collapse are not contradictory.

91

No one measures velocity, actually measures “relative clock diameters,” and entanglement for the fractal clock as explained earlier is all about creating two
complementary guest nested cycles in a single host
cycle of a much longer time scale.
9. Fractal Interference and transition to classical
mechanics and beyond FM: With the fractal harmonic oscillator the interference images appear a bit
different. We have generated wide ranges of interference patterns for the fractal interference in microtubule and Sahu et al. study suggests that if a part of
the pattern is zoomed then a new pattern appears.
10. Ripple effects in the information science due to
three imaginary worlds: Uncertainty principle:
The uncertainty principle that is frequently used as a
certainty limit, even school textbooks give problems
where one finds “time” from “energy” and momentum from the position is not a logical approach.
Fractal information estimates the uncertainty from
detailed time cycle maps between the observer and the
observed, i.e., cells of the fractal tape map each other.

4.2.1 Multilevel Geometric Architecture
of the Hilbert Space
A Bloch sphere with multiple singularity points: Bloch
sphere (Poincaré sphere in optics) is a geometrical representation of a 2-level quantum system, this concept was introduced in 1946 (Bloch, 1946); since then, several attempts
were made to modify it. One critical problem is the generalization of the Bloch sphere to include n level quantum
mechanical system (Kimura, 2003). The surface of the Bloch
sphere is made of pure states, ψ = cosθ 0 + eiφ sinθ 1 with
−π 2 ≤ θ < π 2, 0 ≤ φ < 2π is also called Hilbert space. In order
to increase the number of classical poles n (n ≥ 2, SU ( n) Lie
group) on the surface (a transition from Qubit to Qudit), the
Bloch vector (or coherence vector) does not trace a spherical surface. This is very difficult to imagine, so we built an
analogy. When we have two classical poles A and B, if one
puts a torchlight at pole A pointing to the other pole B, the
projection on the back of the pole would be a circle, and vice
versa. However, when, there are three poles (Qutrit, SU (3) ),
we can do a darkroom experiment shining light to the center
of a glass sphere from three points on its surface. Depending
on the locations of three lights, the central region of the
sphere would lit brightly, so much so that at certain locations,
we might not see the origin of all light sources on the surface of the sphere (Goyal et al., 2011). Instead of three, if one
detects only two light sources, then it is stated that there are
only two pure states, the rest are mixed states. High-density
light patterns would change dramatically inside the sphere as
a function of the number of light sources and their location.
The 3D pattern of bright light domain maps the complicated
topology of coherent vector or Bloch vector, located much
inside the Bloch sphere, a part of the map depicts separated
states and the rest part depicts entangled states (Jakobczyk
and Siennicki, 2001). At n = 8 ( SU (8), E 7 ) , the coefficients of

92

Nanobrain

wave vectors distribute such that a fraction of total topology
remains entangled, the rest turns separable, it is effectively a
classical system (de Wit and Nicolai, 1982).
Vibrating clock: Why should the Bloch sphere expand
and shrink? Geometric algebra addressing the Euclidean
vector space often maps the logic gate operation. It requires
a specific rotation across the trajectories on the topological
space inside the fully deformed Bloch sphere (Havel and
Doran, 2004). As the number of classical state n increases, the
folds in the topology of Bloch sphere complicates. One such
example is Hopf bifurcation in two Qubit system (Mosseri
and Dandoloff, 2001), accessing the desired coherent vector
during a measurement becomes critical. It is not possible to
use the Bloch sphere as a structural unit in FM due to singularity. In the fractal mechanics the singularity points were
embedded on the Bloch sphere and triggered in a loop to activate self-assembly of many information units (Figure 4.2a).
The number of layers through the singularity point equals the
level of the operational imaginary worlds. The loop is around
the great circle, hence, the solid angle created by singularity
points hold the geometric phase (Pancharatnam, 1956) while

the topologically closed-loop tracks the dynamic phase of
the quantum system. If Phase spheres (FM variant of Bloch
sphere) are self-operating, it has to expand and shrink, so that
the trajectories crossover, the geometric phase paths create a
suitable network. In Figure 4.2a we have outlined two types of
Phase spheres, one that changes its surface area to modulate
the infinity, since projection from infinity is our key. The second is the counter Phase sphere with an indefinite diameter, or
multiple diameters coexist. When diameter changes, it means,
a change in the surface area, a single sphere coexists in three
shapes means three imaginary worlds are processing similar
geometric information. The concept of fusing dynamic and
geometric phase in a solid cone is adopted from neutron interferometry results of A. G. Wagh and Rakhecha (1990). As n
increases from 1 to 8, the number of singularity points also
turns eight, increasing n further for useful topology is useless, and literature is rich in mapping such critical folds inside
the Phase sphere. Total dynamic phase for SU (8) would be
exp ( − iσ nα n 2 ) × … × exp ( − iσ nα n 2 ) exp ( − iσ nα n 2 ) = ei∅,
similarly we can extrapolate it for dodecanion, icosanion
with a twist, there would be three such equations coexisting

simultaneously. To engineer singularity, the diameter of the
clocks should vibrate along with the rotation of the system
point.
Bypassing the complex manifolds and adopting the
pattern of primes: As said above, when classical point
increases on a Phase sphere, the surface gets folded in a
complex ­manner. So, an assembly of spheres reduce the
complexity, adds manifold controls which were otherwise
not possible to encode. The replacement of a complex architecture using a group of small spheres (thanks to singularity
points) paves the way to implement the pattern of primes.
Now we suggest a point that absorbs light, say, like a black
hole, neutralizing the complex folds in topology. One could
edit electron spin by shining light, i.e., geometric phase could
be precisely chosen by driving photons in multiple cycles
(Kim et al., 2010) and Cn coefficients that map the topology.
The center of Bloch sphere makes a phase with the topological path between two singularity points, a set of such angles
completing the loop represents the geometric shape made
of singularity points. Thus, the geometric phase that could
be used to run a clock (Badurek et al., 1986) is interpreted
as a measurement of time. Quantifying time as geometric
phase (Wagh and Rakhecha, 1990), store memory and even
decision-making, the solid angular projection through the
geometric phase loop from the center of Bloch sphere is the
basis of replacing curvature on Bloch sphere with another
small sphere. Let us put it in another language. Inserting
a time cycle or time ring using an additional sphere, holding the geometric information would be compensating the
topological deformation. It would increase the probability
of accessing the separable and entangled states would make
computing more feasible. Geometric phase is an integral
part of the Bloch sphere or Phase sphere. However, for quantum computing one needs to switch On and off the motion
of geometric phase through its trajectory. For PPM-GML-H
triad computing that we are exploring in this book, several
system points holding different local clusters of the geometric phases, covering a wide range of imaginary worlds (from
1 to 12, it could be anything), carry out complex tasks. First,
new paths condense at various local regions of the unified
time crystal representing the entire information content
(Figure 4.2b). These independent local regions contribute
to ten different ways to create uncertainty (Figure 4.2c).
The wave function, a clock-structure representation of matter, would have a complex geometric architecture, it would
be a time crystal as shown in Figure 4.2d. A simple wave
function, which was otherwise thought to be a single, mysterious wave-like entity following Schrödinger’s equation,
would now be complex life-like object performing PPM
(Figure 4.2e). For quantum, Bloch spheres infinite solutions
are called Hilbert space. For FM, the Hilbert space analog is
fundamentally different. Two fundamental processes govern
the relative oscillations of the sub-Hilbert spaces. Either they
follow a periodic expansion and contraction; or, all sub-Hilbert spaces would expand and shrink together like one unit
(Figure 4.2d, right). The simultaneous dual-mode is fundamental to find symmetry in a complex ordered factor metric.

93

Superposition of OF-metric and PG-metric as described in
Figure 3.16 is superimposed in Figure 4.2f, to show how the
prime gaps are located in the key locations on the OF metric.
Doing mathematics is not easy for a wave function following
Fractal Mechanics, formulation needs noise, to explore all
possible choices of clock-geometric path and a noise assists
in finding the right choice (Figure 4.3a).
The ultimate engineering of Singularity: an experimental perspective: Whenever a fractal wave function described
above is less than the pixel size (the longest clock is less than
the host, but the host-guest geometry matches), the guest
goes to the imaginary world and a singularity point is created
(Figure 4.3b). Singularities are everywhere in nature, depending on the type of singularity, and the system the architecture of
wave function changes, it may be a quantum or classical but it
has an additional feature of exploring the engineering of multiple worlds (Figure 4.3c). We do not carry out proper experiments to see them. One possible experimental path is fractal
interference using polarized light as shown in Figure 4.3d–f.
Singularity is a time lost in the flipping direction of spin if we
cook a spin-based quantum system, but this particular physical significance is an extremely useful tool. One can insert a
complete-time loop or a clock inside a singularity (Kim et al.,
2010) as shown in Figure 4.3d. Unfortunately, the power of
drawing geometry on a Bloch sphere was never harnessed,
though very recently, its potential is getting recognized (Oh
et al., 2016). The singularity points are not actually a point,
rather, it is a sphere (diameter is set by Rabi Frequency damping, i.e., flipping time for the quantum state) represented by a
function that is non-holonomic, but switches to a holonomic
one as soon as it acquires another time ring of singularities
along its closed-loop trajectory. See the generalized version
in Figure 4.3d. Essentially we get, θTotalN = θGeo( N −1) + θ Dyn( N −1)
and θ Dyn( N −1) = θGeo( N −2 ) + θ Dyn( N −2 ) , if the replacement continues, N→∞, we get pure geometric phase regulating the system. In case pure geometric phase regulates the entire system
we get a quantum time crystal and the output differs between
a classical and a quantum experiment (Figure 4.3d, e).
Eliminating the dynamic phase to create a pure geometric
phase is not new, and the most remarkable advantage is “passage of vibration to the higher level” (Far off-resonant trap or
FORT; Joshi and Xiao, 2006). Joshi et al. beautiful description
of bypassing the core shells ionic vibration to the outer optical cavity nicely fits with Reddy et al. self-similar or fractal
network. The wave function of the system is ψ system = ∏ n e −iθn,
apparently unitary feature is broken, but if we do numerical
simulation relative intensity of the signal is Sin nπ n , which
would be a binary stream of pulses in an experiment like the
one shown in Figure 4.3f. When we consider the geometric
phase, it is independent of the parameters that govern the
path of the projective Hilbert space, thus, it is independent of
the speed.
Why was it essential to introduce a singularity domain
and reject any form of classicality from the Bloch sphere:
We need the undefined singularity points and not classical
that could be stated with an argument. Because (i) we wanted
to use multiple clocks one inside another at various layers,

to model Sahu et al. experimental finding of nested clocks
in the protein complexes. (ii) Creating a fusion of adiabatic
(clock inside singularity) and non-adiabatic system (clocks
reside side by side) is essential to build a generic model
where a sub-system retains virtual isolation from the environment. (iii) A burst from singularity could be a classical
event born out of an undefined function, thus, making classicality an emergent phenomenon from the undefined world.
(iv) We get a virtual spin or directionality, no real direction;
even the direction would remain undefined. Guest Bloch
spheres inside a host Bloch sphere could adopt a composition of various rotational directions, thus, the rotation of
the host would always remain undefined. (v) When a Bloch
sphere is defined in Quantum, a classical certainty is already
included in its poles. Diminishing an essential form of classicality or certainty of the Bloch sphere in the form of 0 and

1 (poles) is required to make a version of Quantum that is
purely uncertain. (vi) Singularity enables escape time fractal to be introduced, fractal clocks bring an imaginary time
(fractal uses iota just like Quantum), and so we do not have
to introduce imaginary space-time unexpectedly as we do it
in the conventional Quantum mathematics. We could derive
the emergence of the imaginary term from a special type
of fractal nature in the information structure. (vii) When
we introduce singularity entire Bloch sphere, and its selfassembled architecture becomes undefined. Therefore, it
is not a Turing machine anymore, it represents the fractal
tape that we proposed to replace “machine.” (viii) When the
entire system becomes a singularity, at a time, at any given
part of the system, the available information is finite. Thus,
unlike Quantum’s Hilbert space, we get a finite projection.
Singularity therefore serves as a route to reject “infinity”

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

and “probability” in a single shot, as “infinity” gives inroads
to the “probability” and “perturbation.” (ix) Uncertainty of
Quantum has been a mystery, and demystification was essential, an absolute singularity at all scales, everywhere in the
system enables generating uncertainty in a logical way in
any system (see ten different ways of generating uncertainty).
(x) Geometry has a classical nature; corners are a certainty,
which ensures incorporation of classical from the backdoor.
Nested singularity enables varying the surface on which the
geometric shape is drawn, so, the triangle is a certainty, but
not the sides or its angles.
Conversion of a fractal Bloch sphere into a Quantum
Bloch sphere and a classical state: The fractal Bloch sphere
turns to a quantum Bloch sphere when the observer’s resolution is less, so it sees the guest singularity spheres on the
host Bloch sphere as the discrete single points (classical).
Consequently, the clock line connecting the singularity points
into a single loop disappears. If there is only a pair of singularity points on the great circle, then it’s a Qubit (0 and 1).
Even for more than two singularity points, since, the singularity domains turn to a point (Qudit), no geometric information
exists. A fractal Bloch sphere, is itself a singularity sphere,
when the entire Bloch sphere converts to a single point, it is
classical. The disappearance of singularity leads to a classical
or a defined state. The loop connecting the singularity points
is not fixed, it connects two rotating system points of loops
located in the neighboring singularity domains.

4.2.2 Fractal Harmonic Oscillator, Fractal
Condensation, and Peculiarities
The maximum number of states a quantum system can
process? A quantum rhythm and quantum time crystal:
In a quantum system, the notion of distinct states is very
well defined, two states are distinct if they are orthogonal.
It has been shown mathematically that a quantum system
with an average energy E could be made to oscillate between
two orthogonal states with a frequency 4E / h. Thus, even
in the quantum scale we can get rhythm (Margolus and
Levitin, 1998). It has also been noted that for very long evolutions that form a closed cycle, the maximum transition rate
between orthogonal states is only half as great as it is for
an oscillation between two states. A quantum system can
run through a long sequence of mutually orthogonal states
for a maximum time τ = N − 1 / N ( h / 2 E ). Interestingly, this
is not only true for the quantum system, for any harmonic
oscillator, it means even for the kind of time crystal, argued
here, but the limits are also valid. One can run through a
long sequence of nearly orthogonal states at a rate Emax / h
or 2E / h, where E is the average energy of the microscopic
system under interaction.
Morphogenesis of information in a time crystal is
multi-layered or fractal condensation: Time crystals arriving through the sensors eventually fall on a resonance chain
that operates following the guidance of a PPM. The resonance
chain morphs the seed geometric shape in the time crystal that
emulates an event happening in nature. The morphogenesis

95

of events happens at every spatial and temporal scale, in the
real human brain and in its analog brain jelly. Mimicking
the frequency space of a 3D time crystal into a real physical
structure or morphogenesis is amazing in the sense that communicating proteins or fourth-circuit elements H (Chapter 8)
would undergo simultaneous changes only at those parts
where minor changes would edit only a few clocks of the time
crystal. Communication means an exchange of local parts of
a time crystal. If one images the shape of those two proteins
or H, apparently both would be silent as if there is no physical movement. If we could enter inside the structure, then we
would find some other structures are changing quite fast. If
we could take one, and enter inside, we would find a large
number of extremely fast shape-changing materials. The journey reveals that two proteins or H devices exchange very
little energy only where the changes should be made. In the
Turing paradigm, one has to carry entire information content, not here. During the exchange, mismatched clocks are
written, this is not new writing, many clocks are not linked,
remain free in the hardware of a resonance chain. They condense to build a new clock. Therefore, the condensation of
carriers in shape-changing material is a part of the information exchange.
Experimental evidence required to establish that fractal
mechanics (FM), a generic form of quantum mechanics
does really exist
1. Fractal fringes: If a system follows fractal mechanics
(FM), then one could zoom any part of the quantum
interference pattern, to discover that there are hidden
fringes. QM has no such provision.
2. Fractal Feynman diagram: superposition of multiple interference patterns: If a system follows
fractal mechanics (FM), then electromagnetic frequencies would be able to track the fractal gaps in the
Feynman diagram and we would get multiple interference patterns for multiple resonance frequencies.
QM does not allow many imaginary worlds to interact and generate superposition of superposed wave
functions.
3. Fractal condensation: Condensation of the vibrational modes in Raman spectrum at the room temperature, one could see live the vibrations collapse at
various frequencies so that peaks merge. It is simultaneous Frölich condensations at multiple singularities;
singularity inside a singularity is a trademark of FM
and does not exist in QM.
4. Fractal coherence leads to the quartet: When two
spins are entangled, it means one wave function,
both particles are actually one in reality and that
is equal to a nested three time cycles. Therefore, a
mother photon can produce a child, a granddaughter
and a great-granddaughter, but the granddaughter’s
child will not be born (above quartet not possible),
a single photon cannot produce infinite progeny in
FM, there is no such restriction in QM.

96

5. Multiple clock entanglement: Entanglement
without an identical point of origin: Until now, it
is believed in QM that entanglement happens only
with photons from the same origin, i.e., among mirror photons, however if FM exists, then it can happen
for photons from other sources too. Thus, suitably
generated photons from different sources if entangles and generates interference then it would establish the existence of FM.
6. Superposition is a function of time: Time cycles
join and disjoin spontaneously, thus, in a suitably
designed fractal tape system, entanglement will be
a function of time. With a suitably designed time
resolution set up, an entanglement would appear and
disappear, as one switch to a different time domain.
Such a feature is feasible in FM, prohibited in QM.
7. Quadrupolar moment changes as a function of
time: One essential outcome of converting all parameters, mass, length to nested time cycles in FM is
that, all higher-order moments change as a function
of time. It is observed in the frequency-time-intensity
3D spectrum during energy transmission between
two objects. QM does not allow this.
8. Frequency wheels of primes determine the system’s nesting: Every fractal tape system has its own
frequency wheels of primes. QM has no provisions
for nesting of waves.
9. Fundamental constants emerge as infinite series
like e, π, and φ: The triangular geometric musical
formulation of number system fractals generate all
other fundamental constants as a single time cycle
and several time cycles inside. QM is not geometric
like FM, the fundamental nature inside of a wavefunction is beyond the limit of QM.
10. Live “beating” communication of three imaginary worlds: One could experimentally verify three
imaginary time worlds simply by experimenting on a
nested quantum system like protein, which has three
layers of quantum systems embedded. Such a nested
QM would exhibit classical, Quantum and fractal
beating simultaneously.

4.2.3 Harvesting Noise by Harvesting Singularity—
PPM Replaces Statistical Mechanics
Space-time and path: From any given point in a spatial
crystal, by moving toward any direction, one would get different kinds of the arrangement of atoms. By rotating 360°,
one should find at least two distinct spatial symmetries. One
cannot imagine a space in a set of time intervals, as one
cannot state a “direction.” If the phase oscillates one full
swing 360°, it is equivalent to the concept of all directions
in a spatial crystal. On the circular 360° path, if at least once
the cycle hosts another small loop that shifts the rate of phase
change, then one gets two time symmetries. A system point
moving along the phase cycle perimeter would experience

Nanobrain

two different rates of time flow (Ord, 2012; Girelli et al.,
2009). The large phase cycle which constitutes a “time” is
called the host time cycle and on its path the local phase cycle
is called guest time cycle. The guest-host phase assembly is
called a time crystal (Winfree, 1977). Phase-shift is fundamental to both space and time, and it is abundant in nature
(Chandrashekaran, 1974). Therefore, information structure, if
it is a 3D phase sphere, could represent all existing physical
parameters comprehensively.
Old schools of statistics to the statistics of primes:
Events are not random, one can predict events with
99.99% accuracy: Maxwell Boltzmann (MB) statistics is
applicable to identical, distinguishable classical particles with
Non-quantized energy, with any type spin (gas molecules).
Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics are applicable to the identical,
indistinguishable particles of zero or integral spin (bosons,
photon, He atom etc.), where any number of particles can
occupy any level. Fermi Dirac (FD) statistics is applicable
to the identical, indistinguishable particles of half-integral
spin (Wu and Cai, 1999). Since only one particle can occupy
any particular level, these particles obey Pauli Exclusion
Principle (electron, proton, etc.). Imagine we have a network
of cells, where a finite number of indistinguishable and distinguishable events are diffusing like particles, colliding
randomly. Unlike spin half or integral spin or anyon, here,
the repeating events with a particular symmetry are indistinguishable. As the symmetry breaks and a new symmetry
starts contributing to the unfolding of the events, then the
events are distinguishable. Conditional distinguishability
was not part of FD, BE, MB, or anyon statistics. PPM is a 3D
architecture where the symmetry of primes is mapped over
the integer space. We define the event as clocking topology,
it means we account for the symmetry of a repeating event
and map the symmetry relation of the constituent events.
Therefore, PPM is a grammar book, if the events change,
how would it follow.
Statistical entropy is perpetually clocking: a matrix of
past-present-future: At certain conditions, a physical system
is bound to transit arbitrarily close to the initial state, even
one with very low entropy (Poincare’s recurrence theorem;
Poincaré, 1890). Zermelo (1896) argued that the Poincaré
recurrence theorem shows statistical entropy in a closed system must eventually be a periodic function; therefore, the
mechanism to increase entropy, is unlikely to be statistical.
At any moment we consider, entropy was more in the past,
will be more in the future, no one answered why it is low
now. Boltzman said, isolated systems are always at maximum
entropy, but suddenly it switches to very low entropy, traps in
a local minimum, so, both the time directions from the bottom now, go upwards. In other words, we take it for granted
that the influences in the other direction, the minute influences that a system inevitably exerts on its environment, do
not “go at haphazard.” Demarcation of past present and future
is a function of the architecture of the time, preferably a time
crystal built using a PPM. The direction of time and entropy
is not objective but an appearance, a product of neighboring
clocks direction, a vector product.

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

The entropy of a series of clock outputs from a biological
system E = −(lnTmax ) −1 ∑Tt =max
1 P (t )lnP (t ). The entropy is known
as Recurrence period density entropy (RPDE) and used to
find the degree of symmetry in a composition of deterministic
and stochastic signals (Marwan et al., 2007).
The weakness of statistical methods: Principle of
independence of incoming influences, PI3: Time asymmetry does not emerge in statistical entropy. Using two criteria,
it is assumed that even before the derivations of statistical
principles. First, the output products of collisions are correlated with one another, even if they will never encounter in
the future. Second, the incoming components of a collision
are correlated, if they have never encountered in the past.
Two assumptions make sure that the previous collisions will
induce correlations between the participants in future collisions. The problem with statistics is that (i) every single
entity and event is equally probable, (ii) an entity that participates in defining statistics is non-deductive, (iii) there is no
emergent property for a given entity, (iv) environment and
boundary properties are imaginary tools of humans like
hidden layers in a deep learning network, (v) no distinction
between past and future of an entity is considered, it involves
only counting, the past is merely the mirror image of the
future. In fact, “that previous collisions induce correlations
between the participants in future collisions” (Zeh, 1989,
1992). Memory has no accountability, the past is an illusion
(von Weizsacker, 1939)! (vi) The universe is made of fractal
branches of systems one inside another, the direction of time
should be in harmony and that communication of time is
not understood (Sklar, 1992). Extreme parallelism and diversity of directions have no internal mechanism. (vii) All kinds
of fundamental waves radiate outward, not inward in nature.
No inward means no mechanism to set direction. Even if
there is an unknown inward wave, radiating to the past and
then the past contributing to the future to direct time and
entropy in a particular direction (Wheeler Feynman absorber
theory) is not possible because absorption is an irreversible
process (Gleick, 1992). (viii) Quantum effect like “advance
action” and “backward causation” defines the direction of
time and entropy (Cramer, 1980). (ix) Two kinds of perturbation modes regulate the universe, one is clocking and the
other static. Combination of various modes of perturbation
expands and contracts phase and at both phases, the system
grows, it defines the arrow of time and entropy only in one
direction (Hawking, 1985, 1988, 1994). (x) Inhomogeneous
anisotropic modes originate at the ground states itself
(Halliwell, 1994), the path integral of the just born universe
account for this confined, limited perturbation that keeps
time and entropy to a minimum. Creatures living at that
time and entropy followed that limit. A century-old effort to
link life, time and symmetry are confined into two choices.
Both are fatal. First, if we opt for low entropy choice, then
we end up in Big Bang and Big crunch. Second, if we chose
underlying physics of the universe is asymmetric in time, the
symmetry of the physics laws that we are an illusion, then
we need to find a missing link, a governing gene of codes
running the universe (Penrose, 1979, 1989).

PPM-based temporal architecture as an alternative to
statistical mechanics: Time asymmetry does not emerge in
statistical entropy. Using, PPM, we map how prime symmetries interact, all possible compositions are mapped in this
infinite 3D architectures. The advantages of this approach
to constitute an alternative to statistical mechanics. (i) Time
asymmetry in the universe is invisible until the architecture
and intricate map of symmetry is understood, this is realized in PPM. (ii) The necessity of inward wave is satisfied
by singularity points. Fourth-circuit element Hinductor is
designed to produce vortex of light and knots of darkness at
the same time, by harvesting singularity. (iii) Addition of a
new symmetry in the metric increases or decreases the number of compositions. That changes the entropy. The universe
is neither symmetric, nor asymmetric, it is an intricate map
of symmetries, PPM. Since adding new symmetries enable a
system to achieve 100% coverage of entire symmetric space
and only 12 primes cover 99.99% symmetries, the entropy
fluctuates in a non-repeating way. PPM pattern is infinite
and never repeats. (iv) Future is the addition of symmetry,
past is a subtraction of symmetry, and the present is clocking
a single symmetry repeatedly. Evolution in the universe is
making a journey from 0% to 100% symmetry structure of
PPM by restructuring the system, repeatedly eon after eon,
from the smallest to the largest. It is similar to the gold universe hypothesis, where at both ends the universe has minimum entropy (Gold, 1962, 1967). (v) PPM appears similar to
Hawking’s explanation where he argues that both at contraction and at expansion phase, the system grows in time and
entropy (Hawking, 1985, 1988, 1994). There is a fundamental difference. In a PPM, it is an architecture of all possible
symmetries, if we move toward zero or infinity, eventually,
the system adds or subtracts symmetry. Therefore, quantum
mechanics is confined within a local disc, a single plate in
the infinite stack of discs in the 3D metric. The interaction
between piles of discs create a beautiful surface gradient of
the metric which describes a new mechanics, we named it
fractal mechanics. Perturbation causes interference, which
in turn generates singularities of various kinds. Fractal
mechanics relies on engineering the singularity in a system.
(vi) PPM does not have to ensure a low entropy of the bigbang or the growth of a conscious brain from a single zygote
cell. It avoids two critical dilemmas. The infinite cycle of
PPM, where we make a journey to cover the symmetry space
99.99999% by increasing the integer N to around 7.6 trillion,
takes the final product and start recounting from 1 to 7.6 trillion again and again and again, we do not have any end anywhere. It is somewhat similar to Penrose’s conformal cyclic
universe where there is no end, but in his proposal, universe
reaches to a finite topology which is retained as the remains
for the next eon (Gurzadyan and Penrose, 2013). For PPM
universe, at primes, entropy reaches minimum, even without a crunch, and follows a beautiful temple-like terrain,
without a collapse, the system becomes a singularity point
for the aeon above, because around 12 primes a system, say
a universe or the brain cannot add a new dynamic to make
a significant effect. (vii) A system is converted into a time

98

crystal; constituent clocks rotate clockwise or anticlockwise.
The architecture of time crystal’s direction of time or direction of entropy is an irrelevant question. Depending on the
set of clocks we chose, on the host Bloch sphere it is a local
flow of time and entropy through the surface of the phase
space. Sometimes, paths are closed (clocking)
or even open.
123
(viii) Penrose calculated that 1 of 1010 universes would have
the right Big Bang. If PPM is considered, universes would
be foolish to go beyond 7–8 trillion choices. If someone
believes in parallel universes, currently at this moment there
won’t be more than 7–8 trillion of them. Around that number 100% symmetry saturation would be reached, and naturally a combination of 7–8 trillion universes would act like a
single atom, but in that effort, would end up building a periodic table full of atoms. The second law of thermodynamics
is a particular line drawn on a PPM’s temple surface. (ix)
PPM is an architecture which is primarily a superposition
of 12–14 prime number related symmetries. That gives birth
to Gauge invariance and several other conservation laws. (x)
PPM’s singularity engineering with GML breaks one old
myth that anything emerges out of singularity should be random (Davies, 1974). That does not happen in a PPM universe,
communication across the singularity points is the foundation of Fractal Information Theory, FIT and GML.
Lotus lotus everywhere, this could be a very nice caption
of the nanobrain if we look at it from the entropy symmetry
perspective. The entropy symmetry relationship of any system
around us is a linear plot that we learn in the textbook. More
is the number of distinct symmetries embedded in a system,
more will be the disorder, and the degree of disorder is the
entropy, so creating a mess increases the entropy of anything
that is in perfect order. However, the picture changes completely when we think of a higher level of architecture. Say,
we have a ten-storied building, and we are creating a mess in
every single floor randomly, shall we plot entire mess up into
one linear plot? Of course, we can do that if we are asked to
provide an account of gross mess up, however, if every single
floor has residents from different nations, different culture
language habits, altogether the variation of the degree of the
disorder will vary distinctly between the floors. Therefore,
as soon as we are asked to provide a dynamic picture of the
degree of the disorder instead of a static one, the entire game
shifts to a different perspective.

4.2.4 What Is Energy in the Many Interacting
Imaginary Worlds?
What would be the energy of the nested Hilbert spaces
and how they would exchange energy: The energy in the
classical and quantum world is a quantity that drives motion.
Here in the universe of time crystals, a suitable analog of
energy is an ability to add more clocks, just like molecular
motors it is not about running but changing three parameters
(Figure 4.4a). First, change in the symmetry, making a structure more and more asymmetric makes it hungry for adding
new clocks and gaining symmetry. Second, the morphogenesis

Nanobrain

caused by changing the directions of the clocks. Even no clock
is added or subtracted to a time crystal architecture, a change
in the direction of rotation alone could generate an asymmetry. Finally, the third important parameter governing the
density of clocks allowed in a host clock. No one ever tried
to encode a geometric shape in a Bloch sphere, continuously.
Since the addition of clock is made deep inside a singularity
point, the shape of the singularity surface is not circular, it
is determined by the geometry of clocks inside, which governs the critical parameter of energy burst from a singularity
(Figure 4.4b). When a single time ring is played out, there is
no logic gate, no reduction of choices, yet a decision will be
made. When the energy is redefined, the correlation between
the prime numbers governs the fractal mechanics and the differences between the classical, quantum and fractal mechanics explicitly reveal this feature (Figure 4.4c).
How entropy changes when universe is a linear chain of
bits to the universe of singular assembly of clocks: In the
language of the bits the entropy of the baby universe as big
bang as deduced from the entropy of the present 2.735 K
(uncertainty<0.05 K) microwave relict radiation totaled over
a 3-sphere of radius 13.2 × 109 light-years (uncertainty <35%)
or 1.25 × 1028 cm,
The number of
bits = ( log2e ) × ( number of nats )
= ( log2e ) × ( entropy/Boltzmann’s constant, k )
=1.44 … x ( 8π 4 / 45 ) ( radius ⋅ kT / c ) 3 = 8×1088
When we switch to the PPM, the matters vibrate in a cyclic
pattern to come to the same starting point, several such loops,
while exchanging energy, a part of that energy is always neither found in any of the participating systems, we call it bond
energy. It can happen at any scale. When a matter or system
gets an energy packet, where does the energy go? It goes to
the structural symmetry. The symmetry defining part always
takes the energy to vibrate, so, replace every matter and
simply consider the structural symmetry, now PPM is like a
matrix of all symmetries of the ­universe. Every single system
in the universe is a composition of multiple symmetries, each
symmetry has characteristic vibrational frequencies and each
object created in the universe has a personalized PPM. Among
three particles, all or a can exchange energy and interact,
see for example a new time crystal-based definition of mass
(Figure 4.5a). If the exchange repeats periodically, then cyclic
energy exchange arises and a periodic oscillation or rhythm
is born, enriching its personalized PPM. In the universe or
human brain the time crystal grows continuously following
PPM and the number of symmetries, that change simultaneously edits the surface area of the time crystal, hence we see in
real-time the change in entropy. Here the physical size of the
universe does not matter, to find the boundary of the universe
we do not need to carry out space travel, seed symmetry of a
few galaxies would repeat, just like the symmetry of tubulin

protein extrapolates a distinguishable feature in the PPM of
Eukaryotic life form. Thus, even if we do not comment on
how the universe was born, what is its future, we could predict a lot using black hole entropy explored here using time
crystals (Figure 4.5b, c). During the interaction, two interacting time crystals, if the observer is morphed it is mass, and
if the observer fails to become a pixel in the host, it creates
space (Figure 4.5b). The transformation of the basic concept
of mass, energy and space helps in reconstructing every single
object in terms of time crystals as outlined in table Figure 4.5c.
Thermodynamic asymmetry: Why time and entropy
flow in one direction Origin of statistical mechanics:
Time is asymmetric, flows to the future and entropy is
asymmetric, only increases with time, both are irreversible
(Landsberg and Park, 1975). It is the current view, which
suggests that once upon a time the entropy was zero and time
had a starting point. For geometric artificial brain, we envision a universe where after integrating around seven trillion

units of information (Clocking Bloch sphere), we reach a
saturation point where adding a new symmetry by introducing a new prime does not help to add distinct dynamics.
It means, in the PPM, a system makes a journey from the
bottom to the top, to the peak of the temple-like structure.
After 1 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 3
1 × 37= 7.420,738,134,810 × 1012 or 7 trillion micro-states
a system be­haves as a single unit, entropy is zero, and the
counting starts from 1, 2, 3, … Entropy is clocking. When a
system is changing, say, water becomes ice and vice versa,
the structure of phase space (Earman, 2006) if determined
would give a reliable description of the microstates. The ab
initio theory of statistical mechanics is extremely debated.
Primarily the reason for debate has been to extract the probability distribution of local groups, the interactions or interventions between the groups to generate a group of generic
probability features, so that various different equilibrium
states are formed as a part of deductive formulations.

Some proposals try to assign initial conditions to override
microstate distribution (Price, 2002) such that the evolution of the dynamics generated by the micro-clusters of
quasi-isolated systems is properly mapped (past hypothesis,
Albert, 2000). PPM is a group of systems, where an integer
represents a single system, or a time crystal, all integers or
systems are quasi-isolated as time crystals overlap, one does
not require to know initial conditions, all possible perturbations are meticulously mapped. So, be it a human brain or
big bang, be it a journey from the bottom of a PPM to the
top, or from the top to the bottom, entropy at both ends is
almost zero, time at both ends is almost zero. In between it
is an architecture of phase, convert it as a structure of time
or phase or an ensemble of frequency (Loewer, 2001) or even
space. One cuts a slice of maximum integer of PPM, and
rolls it into a closed-loop, that is a geometric form of statistical mechanics or fractal mechanics. Thus, background
asymmetry projects time and entropy as asymmetric, but
closing a loop ensures that all laws are time-symmetric.

4.3 A COMPARISON BETWEEN CLASSICAL,
QUANTUM, AND FRACTAL MECHANICS—
SCALE SYMMETRY AND SCALE RELATIVITY
Why 12 imaginary worlds cannot be reduced to one imaginary world: One imaginary world of quantum mechanics
is founded on the fact that momentum and position, energy
and time, angular momentum and angle are connected by an
action called Plank constant h. Now, when angular momentum of magnetic vortex atoms is a dodecanion tensor where
uncertainties of 11 different worlds change the way groups of
imaginary worlds would affect each other, then it cannot be
translated into quantum mechanics (Figure 4.5d). A quaternion has four quantum-like imaginary worlds each world is
2 × 2 tensors, an octonion has 2 sets of 5 quaternions it means
five 4 × 4 tensors, a dodecanion has 3 sets of 5 octonions.
Icosanions have 20 × 20 tensor, hence one could find various
fundamental tensors embedded. Thus, when a system follows
octonion, one could deduce multi-level imaginary worlds into

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

a pair of co-existing hyper-imaginary spaces, which then cannot be deduced to quantum mechanics, it requires a new one.
However, dedocanion does not only spontaneously generates
a hyper-hyperspace of quaternions, the triplet of octonions
means a triangle, a topology that enables hyperspace to hold
three functionally independent universes at a time governing
reality. Thus, the journey of fractal mechanics begins at 12
imaginary worlds, at dodecanion.
Scale symmetry: Those who oppose multiverse, they
need to prove that the universe we live in is not special. If
it is not special, then we do not need many other universes.
One way to do this is to alleviate the necessity of mass and
length from basic formulations. What we would be left with
is a dynamic of symmetry that nature uses as it does not differentiate between the scales. It means if we take a triangle
and draw another triangle inside and continue to do so forever, we get a scale-free symmetry or a scaling symmetry
(Bardeen, 1995). Interaction of charge would spontaneously
break symmetry generating the mass and length. So, the
charge of the particles interacts using equations that has no
mass and length. In some sense the proposal is just opposite to
the idea that suggests time is not required, space is sufficient.
The real mass of the Higgs boson is a billion billion times of
magnitude smaller than the Planck mass, (hierarchy problem),
as per standard models of physics the quantum contributions
from other particles should make the Higgs boson mass, i.e.,
Higgs mass does not exist as a fundamental entity. In order
to explain the discrepancy, supersymmetry was considered,
which studies the existence of anti-matter, both pairs of Higgs
Boson could reduce the effective mass. However, since antimatter is unfound, one way to predict the very low mass of
Higgs Boson is to consider that there is no mass and length in
the universe in reality, it is subject to interaction. Thus, scale
symmetry concept shapes the universe by chance and eludes
understanding.
The concept of scale symmetry has multiple distinct proposals with beautiful consequences. First, since the gravity is
born from zero mass, the elements that interact to give birth to
gravity should not have any effect of gravity. In simple word,
there is no mass, to begin with, that’s why for 30 years, dozens
of predicted particles were never found, probably calculating
the mass was wrong. Second, supersymmetry considers twin
masses, by interacting they can generate plenty of other particles, but scale symmetry does not allow creating new particles
as many as we wish. In the scale symmetry proposal agravity
(Salvioa and Strumiab, 2017), the scale symmetry introduces
two kinds of dynamics, one generates Higgs Boson the other
one generates a billion billion times higher Plank mass, there
is a problem. Negative energy, negative probability and ghost
particles are required which are not real. Third, there exists a
proposal for a hidden sector, the phase transition like events
(Carena et al., 2018) switch Higgs Boson like particles to a
Plank class mass. All existing versions of scale symmetry
models like agravity, hidden sector, predicts new particles,
future experiments might reveal the winner. However, when
we created the chart in Figure 4.5c, the reader could notice
that all of the existing models received a form of acceptance.

Difference between scale symmetry and PPM: For PPMGML-H triad, time crystals are the massless particles which
are made of phase singularities, they constitute a charge, mass
and distance (see Table 4.5c). It is a major difference with the
scale symmetry where a cascade of interactions between the
uncorrelated charges like dominos generates the phase transition. For PPM-GML-H triad, every single parameter, charge,
mass and distance all spontaneously arise, since the geometric
combination of time crystals determines when a phase transition would happen as per the PPM. Thus, spontaneous phase
transitions of time crystals are programmed in the geometry
following PPM.
Scale relativity: Fractal space-time and its relation to
quantum mechanics were proposed in 1981 (Abbot and
Wise, 1981) and fractal space-time came into being (Ord,
1983). Nottale coined the term “scale relativity” a decade
later (Nottale, 1989, 1992). Scale relativity hypothesizes
that space-time in nature is fractal and quantum behavior
comes from that fractal feature. Einstein said, space-time is
curved, and the proponents of fractal space-time suggested
that the traversing paths through the curved space-time are
fractal. Indeed, fractal geometries allow studying such nondifferentiable paths. The fractal interpretation of quantum
mechanics has been further specified (Abbot and Wise, 1981)
showing that the paths have a fractal dimension 2, if infinite
series then 4 + ∅3 (Prigogine et al., 1995). Only scale ratios
have a physical meaning, never an absolute scale. Multiple
proposals exist that quantum mechanical paths or Feynman
diagrams are a fractal path (Kröger, 1997). The fractal path
has non-differentiability. However, the self-similarity allows
generating the paths using complex differential equations.
Some researchers used infinite cantor sets, still, a singular
mathematical function express all of it. The fundamental
“postulates” of quantum mechanics were derived (Ben et al.,
2005) starting from scale relativity. Schrödinger’s equation, the Klein-Gordon, and the Dirac equation can then be
derived (Célérier et al., 2003).
Difference between scale relativity, quantum mechanics
and fractal mechanics: We have made a few fundamental
changes in the concept of space-time curvature. In all fractal
space-time research over 40 years, the fractal path was defined
as a simple equation, repetition of simple geometry. We use
PPM to generate the fractal path, thus, no symmetric entity is
pure, it is all about the composition of symmetries. Feynman
suggested a few diagrams to connect the empty space between
two elements (Feynman and Hibbs, 1965). Fractal space-time
concept suggested that the path is a repetition of geometric
paths for a finite time or infinitely as cantor sets (Prigogine
et al., 1995; Marek-Crnjac, 2009). In general scale relativity, the fractal dimension can take any value, but only one
value. For PPM-GML-H triad, when we use PPM, we have
a superposition of multiple fractals, thus, the fractal dimension is not one, but a set of values, that too, is a function of
location, where on the PPM the selected symmetry is located.
Due to the superposition of several patterns of PPM, we get
non-self-similarity, the changing scales generate several distinct scale-forces or scale-fields, instead of one (Nottale, 1997,

102

2004). In order to analyze, we find self-similarity between
different scale dynamics. It is the reason, we cannot process
the evolution of dynamics using quantum mechanics formulations using mass and length, we change the name to fractal
mechanics. For PPM, if one uses simple patterns its quantum,
complex set of patterns, it is classical, there is no boundary
between classical and quantum-like de Broglie length scale
(Turner, 2013). If a system represented by time crystal uses a
few symmetries, say S, then measuring time crystals M with
simple structures do not change S, hence M gets reproducible
outputs.
Note that scale relativity never attempted to rewrite the formulations of quantum mechanics. They consider the charge
as the basic foundation of all, then derive mass and length
required for Schrödinger’s equation and all other forms of
quantum mechanics. All existing formulations of quantum
mechanics survive. Ours is a version of quantum mechanics that does not use charge or anything like the basic entity,
rather, from a structure of phase inspired by the pattern of
primes we derive all essential parameters. Thence we replace
the equations with a changing geometric structure. We call
this new form of mathematics as continued fraction geometric
algebra, CFGA, where all formulations of quantum mechanics take a geometric shape. Equation = changing geometric
shape. Moreover, since we always put a geometric structure
inside a singularity point, a state is defined using phase value,
no real classical path is there. Since wave functions are nested,
it does not feature wave like but time crystal-like, we are
bound to change the name from quantum mechanics to fractal
mechanics. Scale relativity gives a geometric interpretation
to charges only, we provide clocking geometric interpretation
of everything. Matter wave, Schrödinger’s equation and all
fundamental operators of quantum mechanics could now be
drawn as a 3D architecture of clocks where geometric shapes
are rotating in a typical pattern.
The question may arise, how could it be that there is no
conserved quantity for PPM-GML-H triad? New scale symmetries build all essential parameters from PPM just like the
scale relativity (Nottale, 2011), the only difference being that
for PPM-GML-H triad, it is not a singular symmetry but a
set of symmetries arranged in another symmetry. Geometric
quantization from numbers is not an ad hoc, but a wellobserved feature. Quantization of charge happens because
integers are quantized (Furey, 2015).

4.4 ACTION IS NOT LIMITED TO
PLANKS CONSTANT—EVERY
IMAGINARY WORLD HAS ONE
Deduce the Quantum and our universe from an understanding of existence: The dimension of Plank constant h
is that of action, it is a limit on the position and momentum.
Poor gravitational objects like us (a human body weighs
~70 kg) cannot cross a photon speed c (what makes photon
massless?), similarly, loss-less solitons cannot cross ~10−5c
that means 10,000 times less than the speed of light. If we

Nanobrain

use solitons to communicate and change the state of another
particle far apart, then it will be as slow as the speed of
sound, using effective mass it could be shown that uncertainties and limiting values are there at various energy levels. However, we can even use a diffusion of ions, to lock
particular parameter for hours or even years later; therefore,
eventually, locking coupling values is the stringent condition in entanglement, not the apparent speed, that emerges
with system co-ordination and those are written in the
tensors, e.g., quaternion, octonion, and dodecanions. As
coupling becomes a simple physical interaction, it opens
up worlds beneath classical perception time scale and the
worlds beyond quantum time scales. We have not remained
confined in the materials and carrier transmission, because
that would have confined us in a single clock. The geometry of clocks is limited to 11 layers one inside another for a
dodecanion, all 12 layers have its distinct action, an equivalent of h and in the classical systems we could implement
the concept of imaginary layers, a chart is shown in the
Figure 4.5d, wherein we have used the universal constant
values from the chart of Figure 4.6.
Eleven Mr. Topkins is moving around 11 imaginary
worlds of George Gamow: The rule of the game is that never
separate space and time, if we can preserve their coupling
then even if we move one frame of reference to another the
massively parallel coupling between large numbers of pixels carrying information of the event retains its originality.
Every system built by nature has its own time of reference,
because the speed of a photon in that medium is different from the vacuum. Inside that system, time travels in its
own way. The fundamental rule of the living would change
dramatically in that very world. We know George Gamow’s
story about Mr. Topkins, who traveled to a world where the
maximum velocity of light is only 30 km/hour. Though the
story is wrong completely since the observer always lives in
the current world, and the photon while carrying information might change it suitably to fit that information in the new
world, the story is important to feel the new world. There are
several systems around us that follow the modified “time”
based on photon velocity and or carriers of time defining
action. We live with these worlds together, for dodecanion,
its 11 imaginary worlds. Therefore, the modulation of time
domain by a computing system is essential for the true replication of a natural event. The time-domain means maximum
and minimum time-lapses for all possible events occurring
on the brain. The minimal two events could be a change of
states, the fusion of states to form groups, the disintegration
of groups etc. Eleven layers of actions set 11 Mr. Topkins in
a nanobrain, and brain jelly, how is it possible to manipulate
the symmetry of architecture to modulate the time domain of
pattern evolution in a molecular cellular automaton.
Physical systems (when viewed from a distance) can be
grouped into a small number of classes, with identical scaling laws.

FIGURE 4.6 Fundamental constants found in nature and trying to visualize the constants in a prime-e-prime.

What if our universe is made of virtual atoms of waves,
the universe of mass is an illusion?: Origin of the universe
is beyond the scope of this book, but when the identity of
nature’s true information structure is developed often the
key features of this universe factor in. Battle for the heart
and the soul of physics: Experiments to find out the smallest
indicate that the fundamental constituents of the universe are
10 million billion times smaller than the resolving power of
the Large hadron collider, LHC. Massless virtual objects like
the vortex atoms made of wide ranges of electrical, magnetic,
mechanical ripples are the key ingredient using which the
human brain model and its artificial analog have been created
here. The whole idea that “no mass” or a very low effective
mass is equivalent to an infinite space holds a “time” in it, a
unique time crystal feature has been assigned to tag it as a
mass. In general mass is a geometric shape of a unique kind as
shown in Figure 4.5a, it is in line with the field theory. Fractal
information theory, FIT proposes that rhythms are the keys to
everything that originates from the concept of spin. However,
then replacement does not end in the mass or space, “phase
change” creates both “space” and “mass.”
Spin is a property of a material that enables it to exhibit
the rotational symmetry. For example, the symmetry of a

particle is such that after two rotations, it returns to the initial symmetry, then it is spin ½. However, if just by rotating
180 degree it returns to the initial state, then the spin is 2.
We know that the spin governs the nature of force, why then
we do not see so many different long-range forces other than
photon and graviton. Both are massless, and lower the mass,
more global is the interaction!!!! Of course, Weinberg argued
that more than spin 3 is not possible because they would
not interact, but how true is that proposal is not important.
Wigner found that in the massless situation, instead of
particles labeled by a single spin, there could be a range of
­values. Photons only have the spin 1 label while gravitons
only have spin 2, it could be that the photons and the gravitons
are actually special cases of a more general massless particle
with an infinite list of integer spins. The massless particle is
labeled by spin 0, 1, 2, 3, all the way to infinity! Wigner called
these “continuous spin particles” (CSPs; Schuster and Toro,
2014). The spins are definitely discrete not truly continuous
(see below QSP). For FIT, these are signatures of a time crystal or organized spin foam where each spin is a guest clock
located on a host clock.
Weinberg showed how the spin of a particle could provide
insights into the electromagnetism and the gravity. Continuous

104

spin particles (CSP) are objects with all possible spins. Natalia
and Toro argued that instead of all possible spins, the spins
would take certain values, Quantized spin particles or QSP
(Schuster and Toro, 2013). It would definitely change the way
we look at nature. When the geometric space was imagined
for the number system theory, imaginary iota was brought in
and showed that it returns the quantized values. Dodecanion
in combination with octonion and quaternion would bring
about further organized structures where symmetry would
govern the degree of quantization.

4.5 A TABLE OF FUNDAMENTAL
CONSTANTS IN NATURE
Fractal space-time: Throughout this book, we do
not debate whether our brain is a classical or a quantum
device because if the two formulations are combined then, the
fractal space-time features naturally make a smooth transition
from classical to the quantum regime. Feynman showed that
the quantum mechanical paths that contribute mainly to the
path integral, these paths are non-differentiable and are fractal. Though there are three routes following which the laws
of quantum mechanics are derived from the fractal geometry
of space-time (theories of scale relativity). The first route is, a
random walk through the Feynman chessboard as suggested
by Ord et al. Second is the scale relativity approach wherein
a collection of coordinates, some points are finite, has limits,
so its classical and some points in the space-time are fractal,
means, infinite, and minimum energy path or geodesics are
irreversible. When these typical fractal features are applied to
classical coordinates, Newton’s equations are written in terms
of Schrödinger’s equation (Nottale, 2005). So, quantum to
classical transitions is feasible in fractal worldview. Third, El
Naschie approach, where he replaced the “continuity” part of
a fractal and replaced it with the Cantorian space-time fabric.
The Cantorian approach is exciting because using this spacetime fabric, all fundamental constants including the fine
structure constants, gravitational constants are derived (El
Naschie, 2004, 2009). The approach allows the formation of
wild topologies (multi-fractals). A Cantorian space-time metric uses multi-fractals, means fractals with different dimensions, this generates the E8 symmetry. The experimental
verification of a unique fusion of E8 symmetry (248-dimensional rotational symmetry) is shown, we call it the lotus symmetry. One reason for stressing a new metric—fractal time
considers no limit, not even in the Plank dimensions, hence,
the Plank cut off as considered by some fractal space-time
theories contradict themselves. PPM guides linking the symmetries, no imagination on the space-time could be left out.
Explaining all of quantum mechanics using geometry:
The foundation of entropy and fundamental constant:
Wheeler tried to explain everything that is happening in the
universe in terms of changing geometric shape. Now, Wheeler
used classical points, not phase space like us to construct the
geometric shape. As a result oscillating geometric shapes
gave rise to incredibly non-physical behavior at certain scales.
The boundary of a boundary is zero is the foundation principle

Nanobrain

of geometric algebra (Spanier, 1966). As Wheeler argued,
“we will someday complete the mathematization of physics
and derive everything from nothing, all law from no law.” We
extend the statement here, possibly, one day we could derive
everything from a metric of primes including all laws. In brief,
the choice of the question asked, and choice of when it’s asked,
play a part—not the whole part, but a part—in deciding what
we have the right to say (Wheeler, 1984, 1986). When phase
singularity accommodates geometric shapes, the boundary of
a boundary is zero, shapes, irrespective of their oscillations are
confined within the singularity domain. Hence non-physical
situations do not arise. Due to the PPM we find that each
prime writes its typical signature in the metric of primes, we
can easily test it by keeping say products of 11 only to see
what prime 11 does to the metric. Consequently, we found
that around 15 proteins are sufficient to generate a self-similar
pattern for each prime as a physics law and typical curves at
the junction of two primes as a fundamental constant. Thus,
universal physical laws are observed in the changing geometric shapes generated by primes. Not just quantum, serious
attempts were made to include gravity as changing geometric
shape (Wheeler, 1967; Misner et al., 1973) that could be done
with PPM and GML, as we would see below. We do not try to
derive quantum origin, but we see quantum as an opportunity
to resolve the asymmetric flow of time and entropy (Price,
1996).
The emergence of fundamental constants from PPM:
Fundamental constants are not that universal as we are taught
in the textbooks, they vary with measurement conditions and
environment (Gross, 1989). Figure 4.15a explains Fundamental
constants are functions of e, π , and Φ. These three fundamental constants e, π, and Φ. are connected by quadratic
relations. If in our universe, there truly exists an orthogonal
triangle of e, and Φ, whose three angles are θ1 = cos −1e/π , and
θ 2 = cos −1ϕ /π , which could change. The quadratic relation is
beautiful, since angles between e, π and Φ, π change, keeping
2
2
2
the quadratic relation e + ϕ = π intact. In the PPM when we
find the topological shapes (12 has 3 nested points, hence a
triangle, 8 has one nested point so it refers to a singular point,
etc.) by the time we reach 1012 integer space, covering 1 × 2 ×
3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 37 = 7.420,
738, 134, 810 × 1012 = B (Brahman), we get dodecahedron,
a 20 planar 3D architecture. If we include two more primes
41 and 43 to avoid the debate whether 2 is at all a pure prime,
B = 1.308276133167003e + 16. We can go for a higher number of clocks but as explained in Chapter 2, even if we build
a system with more number of clocks, we will not add more
symmetry to the universe. Ninety-nine percent of all nonprimes could be created by 12 primes only, therefore, it is wise
if we reach the number B, we would consider the whole system
as one unit and start counting again, 1, 2, 3, … n. It means,
starts building a new system. Now, we have also explained
in Chapter 2 that due to phase quantization we get clockwise
and anticlockwise rotations, but, certain integers start the rotations in the phase space, the others follow. The rotational space
forms a lotus satisfying various logarithmic spirals, around
e 2 + ϕ 2 = π 2. In the PPM, as distinct metrics generated by each

105

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

prime superpose, certain critical folds with an angular gap
θ need to be bridged for generating a continuum in the metric. The bridging factors are fundamental constants that we
see around. The generic formula for fundamental constant is
θ (e 2 + ϕ 2 ) ± prime. It is not the ultimate one, it is the first and the
most primitive attempt to topologically derive the fundamental
constants in the future (Figure 4.6). Consequently, the physics
laws would be born in the landscape of symmetry, PPM.

4.6 QUANTUM INTERFERENCE- AND
FRACTAL INTERFERENCE-EXPERIMENT
ON A SINGLE MICROTUBULE
A journey to entanglement in room temperature under
noise: The hallmark of a quantum oscillator is a textbooklike quantum interference pattern depicting the wave functions of the quantum well with all possible nodes starting
from the ground zero. Nanoelectromechanical oscillators
(NEMS) are the newest classical window to the quantum
world. Microtubule nanowire found abundantly in eukaryotic
cells (Figure 4.7a), spontaneously generates a pair of coherent
sources due to birefringence (Figure 4.7b). Sahu et al. carried
out a series of experiments on a single microtubule to check
if it is a quantum device (Figure 4.7c). While basic relation
hυ = k BT sets limits to the quantum preparation and measurement (Figure 4.7d), the thrust to bring quantum features
to the classical regime remains confined either in ultra-cold
temperatures and/or in an ultrafast time domain. Journey to
hot entanglement has stemmed recently (Galve et al., 2010)
by squeezing the normal mode of vibration of synchronously
coupled oscillators vulnerable to heat contacts, advancements
are too limited to make an impact. Thanks to quantum-discord
that harness quantum benefits, even without entanglement.
Squarely apart, on a carpet of strongly coupled oscillators, the
coherent stream of soliton particles does not de-cohere under
thermal or electronic noise, remains pristine for kilometers;
thus, could replace the entangled atoms or ions. However,
the problem for not having superposition principle restricts
their localization; hence, quantization is possible only if individual solitons are weakly coupled, non-linearly shaping into
a waveform (Rajaraman, 1982). Once soliton’s limitation to
form wave is resolved, discretely spaced soliton-particles all
along the NEMS structure are synchronized as sinusoidal
wave delivering all that quantum entanglement and quantum
superposition had promised, semi-classically, in the open air
(Figure 4.7e). Quantum was prepared theoretically, using solitons; but no attempt was made to realize it experimentally by
breaking the limits set by hυ = k BT .
With an ideal ferroelectric behavior (Tuszynski et al.,
1985), microtubule is piezoelectric, oscillates mechanically
if an electrical signal sent through it (Sahu et al., 2013a,
2013b); lattice sites on the cylindrical 2D surface generates symmetrical points in the power spectrum, with large
piezoelectric degrees of freedom. Size of the constant-voltage step in multiple ferroelectric states measures the degree

of resonant velocities of solitons; thus, varying ac driving
bias the velocity of solitons could be controlled. Velocity
tunes delay, essential to generate normal modes of vibration among all the classical soliton particles vibrating at the
single resonance frequency. MT’s dc resistance remains constant unless an ac signal of particular frequency triggers one
of the eight co-existing quantum wells inside and release
energy to the external circuit reducing the contact-resistance.
Even a ±50 mVrms ac signal turns a ~23.5 μm semiconducting
MT (1–10 MΩ or ~300 MΩ) into a nearly ballistic conductor (39 kΩ~3G0, independent of L), at those eight resonance
frequencies (f) ~15 kHz(Q~4,|1>), ~9 MHz(Q~43,|2>), ~12
MHz(Q~75,|3>), ~15 MHz(Q~46,|4>), ~18 MHz(Q~64,|5>),
~20 MHz(Q~110,|6>), ~22–23 MHz(Q~129,|7>), ~24–25
MHz(Q~62,|8>, Figure 4.7f). Length variation study of resonance peaks shows that a single microtubule exhibits any one
of the four pairs of dominating peaks, |1>|2>, |1>|4>, |1>|6>
and |1>|8>. The co-existence of two peaks reflects the possibility of four quantum bits. four distinct coherence times
that a particular microtubule delivers for four quantum bits.
Soliton takes 23.5 × 10−9s (τ φ = Lϕ / c, c~102–103 m/s) to cross
Lφ, since coherence time τC>τφ, quantum bits can survive sufficiently long to observe classically.
Microtubule is quantum device but only at certain ac
frequencies: During four-probe quantum interference measurements using a single microtubule device (Figure 4.7c) it was
found that at certain ac frequencies, there is a current at zero
gate bias and zero probe bias (quantum), at all other frequencies the center is dark (classical). Two coherent electromagnetic
(em) pulses are given by E1(t ) = ( A(t ) exp(ik1r ) + c.c ) / 2 and
E1 ( t + τ ) = A ( t + τ ) exp(ik2 r ) + c.c / 2, where τ = 2π d / λ ,
d is the path difference, λ is the wavelength of em signal, k is
wave vector, c.c is complex conjugate. The intensity of their
2
interference pattern is I = E1(t ) + E2 (t +τ ) =C + A(t ) A* (t +τ )
cos{( k1 − k2 )r}, here normalized temporal coherence function is
γ (τ ) = A(t ) A* (t + τ ) / C . When we change the em frequency, we
tune τ (delay), which first increases and then decreases the amplitude I of the output signal, i.e., γ (τ ). Full-Width-Half-Maxima
(FWHM) for Γ = I max − I min I max − I min vs. τ provides the coherence time τϕ (Iwata and Hieftje, 1992). When the gate voltage
changes (inner electrodes in Figure 4.7c) the Fermi-level of
synchronized soliton packet, original and gate-modulated
(wavenumber, k) signal develops a phase difference, which
generates a Quantum Interference pattern but only at certain
frequencies.
One easy way to prove that microtubule follows fractal
mechanics or it is a fractal harmonic oscillator is to zoom
the interference pattern (Figure 4.7g). If applied bias shifts
wave vector k largely by zooming a particular domain
as shown in Figure 4.7g, only the ballistic paths for solitons change, the weak coupling among all the solitons is
not affected, so we observe a similar pattern. It also depicts
that transition to hexagonal lattice phase is essential for
two co-existing quantized soliton waves to reside physically on the MT surface. Distinct quantum interference
patterns for eight dielectric resonant states in the range
was 10 Hz–50 MHz for different lengths, confirms MT’s

identity as octave quantum-like cavity-resonator. In sharp
contrast to conventional resonators (mV, mA~microwatt),
microtubule operates in the atto-watt (μV, 10 pA) domain,
consuming 1010 orders lower power. Since coherence length
is ~23.5 μm all microtubules produced in any living eukaryotic cells, brain neurons are a quantum-like device, if and
only if one triggers it with a suitable ac frequency. Two
possible co-existing lattice paths on the hexagonal tubulin lattice those constitute a quantum bit is also explicit in
molecular simulation.

4.7 FRACTAL ABSORPTION–EMISSION OF
THE OPTICAL BAND OF A NANOBRAIN
Molecular foundation of the fractal logic gate: We discuss
the design and synthesis of a Fractal logic gate that operates with pH and density as input variables (Ghosh et al.,
2015b). Fractal logic gate means its truth table is not permanent; any operational region could be zoomed to get a new
truth table, continuously. Thus, it can sustain changes in the
input condition unlike conventional molecular logic gates.

Fractal Mechanics Is Not Quantum but Original—Geometric Algebra for a Dodecanion Brain

The fractal feature was never realized in a logic gate before.
Fifth-generation PAMAM dendrimer [P] encapsulated with 2
Nile Red [C] molecule and surface attached with 32 molecular
rotors [M] and 4 pH sensor molecules [S] is the functional unit
whose water solution was used as logic gate matrix, including
PCMS; we call it PCMS or nanobrain (Ghosh et al., 2015a).
The final derivative is 10–15 nm wide particles. The logic
gate output is read by measuring fluorescence. Proper choice
of functional groups balances the energy transfer between
encapsulated molecule inside the dendrimer and the externally attached functional components, we image that energy
transfer route (M↔C↔S) precisely using combined excitation-emission spectroscopy (CEES). One could zoom a CEES
spectrum similar to the interference pattern described above,
to find that new bands are found (Figure 4.8a). The reason is

107

not newer parts of the molecular structure being probed, rather
an interaction of participating molecular systems. A few functional groups using the phase interaction build a dynamics that
is similar to a fractal, say Mandelbrot fractal needs only one
imaginary world and it can create an infinite space using that
(Figure 4.8b). Fractal logic gate feature is aimed at delivering programmed output at all scales using a single instruction
(Figure 4.8c) even under noise, e.g., drug delivery systems,
chemical pattern recognition, chemical data encryption, etc.
A note on chaotic, deterministic and quasi-determinism
in computing: Unlike deterministic system, a chaotic system
is apparently random but predictable only if we know the initial condition, see butterfly effect, thus one can calculate the
output of such a multi-directional chemical reaction. In contrast, in a classic random system, the same reaction would give

different results in two consecutive runs. The three systems are
(i) “chaotic (if we know input then predict random output),”
(ii) “random (even if we know the input, cannot predict),” (iii)
“deterministic” (input-output fixed). Here we realize “quasideterminism,” a system where a reaction system always
approaches determinism, but as an asymptotic function, the
determinism is never reached. Say, the solution is 1, the system reaches 0.999 then after some time, 0.9999999, etc., then
if conditions change then if the output is 2, the reaction system
drives toward 1.99 then 1.99999, etc.
Triangular energy transmission network in nanobrain
enables accurate programming: Period, or time cycle or
rhythm is what remains constant even under random PCMS
(nanobrain) motions. Strict energy transmission route like
M↔C↔S is itself a rhythm encoded in the atomic arrangements and PCMS restores it under noise. The attempt allows
PCMS to sustain a defined geometric path on a surface under
noise and a logical fluorescence output in solution even
though a particular pH and density range are continuously
zoomed creating a fractal logic gate. Fractal gate means one
can continuously zoom to expand any part of the operational
matrix converting say, a 10 × 10 pH-density matrix into a
1000 × 1000 one, thus, eventually capturing astronomically

large data. Even for a large matrix, time-lapse is determined
by the smallest matrix time cycle, this is what we call “instantaneous”—it’s finite indeed.
Fractal reaction kinetics to synthesis brain jelly:
However, M↔C↔S vibrational chain has been programmed
by Ghosh et al. to replicate the evolution of neural network
circuits in a chemical beaker (Figure 4.8d–f) using fractal
reaction kinetics, see Chapter 9 for details. However, we
should note here that the fractal synthesis that repeats the
formation of triangle and square alternately (Figure 4.8g)
and sphere, spiral alternately (Figure 4.8h) from 8 nm to
millimeter-scale is an amazing (Ghosh et al., 2016b) observation. Therefore, fractal mechanics could be used using
table 4.5d, from building decision-making devices to the
chemical reaction kinetics. Universalization of the Plank
limit would have enormous effects on the materials engineering in the coming days.

Figure 4.9 also describes how one could write complex
equations with multiple variables. We noted above that a
black filled circle, is a variable say x. Now, if we have multiple
variables, then we need to write it on a Bloch sphere or 3D
phase space. If we have multiple functions then on the sphere
each function acquires a plane with a vector that is an axis of
rotation or central control. The difference between a function
and an equation is that an equation has an additional circle or
clock that loops all functions into a bond.

power of functions. Integration and differentiation are opposite processes. One nice example is shown in Figure 4.11b,
where we differentiate one of the products for partial differentiation. A partial differential equation is realized by keeping
a set of clocks intact and changing a few. Figure 4.11c enlists
the process on how to geometrically address differential
equations of different orders. There are several popular equations made of partial differentiation, they appear beautiful.
Lie algebra and bypassing the non-differentiability:
The physical significance of log is that a physical parameter
varies depending on how much a parameter weighs at that
point. Now, this is a very interesting situation even if we have
a single log relation. Lie algebra (Bourbaki, 1989) developed
in the 1930s nicely address this issue. Kac-Moody Algebra
(1960) an extension of Lie Algebra developed over a complex
space addresses infinite dimension. The linear space transformation that governs the “rate of change” could be a complex
number if there is self-similarity, in PPM-GML-H triad case
we have self-similarity. Now, the interesting part is that the
linear space transformation cannot define a rate of change
which contains a parameter that is defined by another complex
number’s space transformation. In such situations, without a
debate in mathematics we consider that a function becomes

ways for subtraction. The system of clocks naturally decides
to go for addition or subtraction based on the rotational direction of the clocks, those who run in the same direction, go for
addition and those who run in the opposite direction, subtract.
Panel “c” shows different ways for the division. In the case of
division, it is important to isolate the time crystal representing the number into multiple parts based on the symmetry of
the divisor. For example, if we are dividing by 2, then using
the C2 symmetry, we would divide the time crystal into two
different parts. If dividing by 103, then we would split the time
crystal into three parts, there is a simple way of doing it. Panel
“d” shows different ways for multiplication. Here to multiply,
one has to insert the time crystal for one integer into the singularity points of the other. Panel “e” shows that if the division fails, how fractionalization, could take over and if there
is no completion, the process would continue.

an undefined mathematical entity. However, we leave with a
major conclusion that since in PPM-GML-H triad case the
complex number’s real and imaginary parts are frequency,
therefore, we have an imaginary space-time world inside
another imaginary space-time world and so on. Already a part
of this theory was formulated in Riemannian manifold.
Iterative function systems are resolved in the images given
to the new class of computer in the way described above, however, during computation, at different layers of the hardware,
synchronization and de-synchronization of the resonant oscillation continue. Computing time is the synchronization time
of the fractal seeds. Synchronization leads to coherence which
means Fractal seeds oscillate in the same phase and frequency.
Spontaneous switching between synchrony and de-synchrony
is essential, thus, entanglement is not a ­pre-requisite. The information perspective of that physical process of computing is
that several fractal seeds of iterative function systems form
the network, coupling and de-coupling of large networks is a
generic event that happens during computation.
Lie group, conformal group of the sphere: Geometric
language of PPM computing: The conformal group is the
group of transformations from a space to itself that preserve all
angles within the space. It is the group of transformations that
preserve the conformal geometry of the space. Harry Bateman
and Ebenezer Cunningham showed in 1908 that the electromagnetic equations are not only Lorentz invariant, but also
scale and conformal invariant (Bateman, 1909). Putting coordinates together with sphere’s radius was Lie’s first work in
1871, The conformal group includes the Lorentz group and the
Poincaré group as subgroups, but only the Poincaré group represents symmetries of all laws of nature including mechanics,
whereas the Lorentz group is only related to certain areas such
as electrodynamics. Due to this universality, the conformal
feature has been used in constructing the geometric language
for PPM computing. All basic geometries used as letters for
operational language are encompassed inside a circle or sphere
and ratios of contact coordinates are used. The preservation of
conformational geometry enables a precise encoding of sensory data as a stream of nerve impulses. List of simple Lie

This book does not endorse any unified theory starting from a
single geometry because PPM metric described in Chapter 3
demands for several evolving vortexes each carrying a distinct
PPM, and depending on its prime number origin, the evolution
of symmetries change, redefine. Also, for a conscious machine,
E8 does not suffice, we need a dodecanion with 11 imaginary
and one real world, whose manifold geometries with 12 planes
overlap to create a physical form of conscious thought.

4.8.3 CFGA Operator That Runs 13 Math
Operations in a Time Crystal
Structure
In Figure 4.12, we have summarized a list of 13 mathematical operations described in Figures 4.9 through 4.11.
One of the most important features of continued fraction

111

geometric algebra, CFGA is that naturally it is selected
which means, from outside, there would be no need to
encode an instruction. Time crystal self-assembly is a process that detects minute simple changes or differences in
the structure is detected and action is detected. The third
and the fourth columns of the table in Figure 4.12 lists
processes in such a way that materials self-assembly runs
as is mathematical operations. Thus, careful observation
of this table would reveal that natural weak interactionbased material self-assembly of Hinductor devices would
spontaneously trigger the actions listed in column 4.
CFGA operator execution is not a linear sequential process, its managed by a time crystal, which helps to isolate
typical mathematical operations and run them repeatedly
so that particular self-assembly process autocorrects itself
if there is an error. One such problem is described in the
bottom right panel of Figure 4.12. Interaction between the
imaginary worlds is a critical aspect for the quaternion,
octonion and dodecanion tensors. There are three aspects
that create information exchange channels between different imaginary worlds. The journey through singularity
addresses the power of an integer, tensor element transformation and finally fractal geometry.

4.9 THE FUNDAMENTALS OF QUATERNION,
OCTONION, AND DODECANION
No more Fano plane, now it’s time for manifolds: Using
shades, we have pointed out how one could find a quaternion in the octonion and dodecanion in Figure 4.13. Most
off-diagonal elements of the four multiplication tables for
dinions, quaternions, octonions and dodecanion are antisymmetric, making all four of them almost a skew-symmetric matrix except for the elements on the main diagonal,
as well as the row and column for which h0 is an operand.
A single Fano plane that links seven imaginary worlds with
seven lines explains the multiplication of an octonion world.
One could notice the clocking loops in the Fano plane, each
loop is made of three elements, making sure that a triangle is stored even at the smallest level, when each element
is a singularity point. The clocking direction is fixed and
very important, so they do not build a matrix but a tensor.
Similarly, when the clocks made of three singularity points
are used to build the multiplication of a dodecanion world,
we find that four planar structures are required instead of
one. One planar structure is made of 11 points centered at
1, here 9 occurs twice, so we need to fold the plane, two
points with 9, touch each other. The second planar structure
is made of 13 points centered at 11, here 3 occurs thrice.
The third planar structure is made of 9 points, where 4, 5, 6,
and 7 occur twice. The fourth planar structure has 6 points.
In order to understand how a dodecanion tensor would connect the clocking triangles, we need to join the four planes
by touching the common points. Thus, we get a manifold.
The journey to manifold machines begins here, we have
outlined the futuristic machines in Figure 10.12.

4.9.1 The Rule of 11D Manifolds
A quaternion-topology of dodecanion for consciousness:
One interesting plot at the bottom of Figure 4.13 is that there
is three quaternion composition for the dodecanion. The coexistence of three distinct quaternions suggests that simultaneously three solutions would generate for every single
dodecanion produced in a device. It means single hardware, if
it acquires a topology that allows it to put three, time crystals
of solutions in the three singularities, a new time crystal is
born with a triangular control. When each contributing element from the tensor is a singularity point, for a dodecanion
tensor, the triangle made of quaternions as noted above, would
be a higher-level geometry. However, when eleven imaginary
worlds would send complex time crystals, the resultant quaternion as shown at the bottom of Figure 4.13 would depict a new
phenomenon. At the highest level, when all the components
have already contributed, three distinct information processing could run at a time in the single hardware. In quantum,
one could sense the contributions from unknown to the reality,
but when 12 imaginary layers operate together, the hardware
could remain in the imaginary world, with a distinct geometric

identity, here it’s a triangle. The ability of single hardware to
package entire information in three identical parts and then
edit three of them independently is considered here as consciousness. The quaternion-topology of dodecanion satisfies
the minimum requirement for reverse engineering a conscious
machine, for the higher-level tensors, one could extrapolate
consciousness to a superior scale as outlined in Figure 10.12.
Where does the physics laws come from? What distinguishes between laws and no laws is a mystery (Goodman,
1954), it was suggested that the laws are relations between properties or universals (Armstrong, 1983). It was a departure from
Hume that “laws assert no more than regularity of coincidence
between instances of properties.” There are anti-reductionists
who think that there are laws in the universe, but no need to specifically appeal to properties or universals (Woodward, 1992).
Anti-realists think that there are no laws in the universe. Two
arguments we note. First one is that all generic laws are derived
in a boundary condition, outside, it is not verified cannot be
said to be valid, a law should be an external entity (Mumford,
2004). The second one is that derived laws are properties of a
system, not a system-independent feature that a system follows

(Giere, 1999). The most important of all, if there is any law,
how did they come into being (Cartwright, 1997). Since we
derive fundamental constants partially from the PPM and geometric musical language (GML), various topological identities
like e 2 + ϕ 2 = π 2, we avoid laws, generate the transition of one
dynamic to another. Thus, when we convert properties or universals as changing geometric shapes, and link them using the
metric of symmetry, PPM, the laws may or may not be out there
in the universe, at least we do not have to find them.

Figure 4.14 explains how different imaginary worlds of
the quaternion, octonion and dodecanion tensors operate.
The tensor elements affect different imaginary worlds. While
doing so, there is a topological restriction which is geometric

in nature, then there is a materials restriction which is weak
interaction based self-assembly rules, finally there is a manifold restriction which is regulated by the symmetry of the
distribution of primes. Twelve equations which were noted
earlier in the context of geometric operation in Figure 3.12a.

important, since, here, no logic works, geometric self-similarity or numerical self-similarity is a feature that is truly
fractal but absent in the pattern of primes. In fact since a
pattern of primes never repeats itself, it is impossible to
find a rule, making a decision. The projection from infinity
is also like normalization that bridged singularity in the
1930s, but with a difference that it provides much more
insight into the singularity before bridged using fractal
seed geometry and neglecting the true delicacy of nature.
Also, at the same time, here we know what we are losing,
but in the conventional normalization it was an unknown
process.

4.11

DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPIRALS IN NATURE

The origin of spirals come from hyperspace geometry. Here is
a simple example of hyperspace equilibrium generating various spirals.
Prime number theorem implies that Pn ∼ nlnn , wherefrom
it has been derived that if π ( n) is the number of primes less

or equal to n, then lim supn→∞ ( Pn+1 Pn )π ( n) = e while the lower
limit of the same function is 0. The total contribution of n
primes ∑in=1 CPn , if infinite integer space is depicted as unity,
the normalized density of primes DPn = 1 − ∑in=1C Pn, within a
certain range, if there are r primes Ps ≤ Pn ≤ Ps+ r , we get ∆DPr .
If we consider paired primes, since lim r →∞ (1 + 1/ n) n ∼ e we get
lim n→∞ ( Pr +1 Pr ) r ∼ lim r →∞ (1 + ∆ DPr Pr ) r ∼ lim r →∞ (1+1 ϕ ) r ~ e.
Here φ is the golden ratio, i.e., if a and b are two primary linear distances, they self-assemble to determine the next length
as a+b, then ϕ = ( a + b)/ a.
Wherein ( Pn + Pn+1 ) / Pn ∼ ( a + b) / a ∼ j across N is a
logarithmic variation, i.e., we get e along the horizontal.
Moreover, if we implement the planar angular drift explained
earlier, then the projected normalized hyperspace (1 :ϕ ) is a
golden ellipse with an area π. Projected hyperspace by ϕ and
e for any dimension is the sum of their generic power, hence
we get ϕ Jh + e Jh, now since the projected hyperspace of ϕ
and e is π (π measures points in H1; see Figure 4.15a) in one
dimension and ( pγ = lπ , i.e., total points = total lines; i.e.,
total area = total lines = total points), therefore, sum of their

orthogonally coupled hyperspace is the hyperspace created
by π of the same order ϕ Jh + e Jh = π Jh . Now we try to find the
value of Jh, we can easily estimate that Jh > 2 (for orthogonal triangle a2 + b2 = c2, hence Jh(min) = 2. The orthogonal
relationship suggests that ideally angular deviation should be
30°, 60°, and 90° following the ratio ϕ : e but ϕ is a function
of (Pn + Pn + 1)/Pn, so is e.
First, ϕ and e are orthogonally connected to hyperspace, ∑ r∞=11 + (k / e)r = ϕ ; k (e) =1.05, and ∑ ∞r =11 + (k /ϕ )r =e;
k(ϕ ) =1.03, so it proves that they are orthogonally coupled, but
the hyperspace is not planar ( k (e) − k (ϕ ) = ∆ Jh ≠ 0 ). We vary
the ( Pn + Pn+1 ) / Pn ~ ( a + b) / a~ j plot. Note that RNP(Δnr) generates various logarithmic variations. It shows that the projected
hyperspace could be spherical, ellipsoidal and hyperbolic,
depending on the non-linear oscillation frequency matching
between two neighboring closed loops in the NC/OF metric.
The deviation in the projected hyperspace is strictly a function
of deviation in orthogonality, ∆ Jh; hence Jh = Jh ( min ) + ∆ Jh.
Here, its 2.00001 (an infinite series). In order to verify, we
assign ϕ (AB) and e (BC) two perpendicular sides of a triangle

ABC, where angle/ABC = 90°, while AC is π . We find that
if Jh = 2.02… The angle between π and e measured by e is
29.62°, the same angle measured by ϕ is 31.28°. The angle
between π and ϕ as measured by e is 60.42°, and measured
by ϕ is 58.75°. The deviation of ±1.6° is from non-planar projected hyperspace. ABC relates ϕ , e and π as e 2.0 + ϕ 2.0 = π 2.0 .
Second, by continued fraction expression for ϕ and e are a linear function of N as N →∞, while π infinite continued fraction needs a square of integers π = f ( N 2 ), while π 2 = f ( N ),
hence π 2 could integrate both ϕ and e as the sum of areas. We
estimated π accurately from e 2.0 + ϕ 2.0 = π 2.0 . Once the triangle
with hyperspace twists the Jh value, at least seven distinct 2D
spirals (see Figure 4.15b) and five 3D spirals (Figure 4.15c).
When these topologies are projected in the fractal space-time
of nested clocks (Figure 4.15d) or in the fractal space-time of
nested regular grid pathways (Figure 4.15e) we derive the resonance bands.
In the resonance bands of Figure 4.15f, we see that electrical
resonance frequencies are f e 0 , π f e 0 , π 2 f e 0 ,π 3 f e 0 …, mechanical
resonance frequencies are f m0 , ef m0 , e 2 f m0 , e3 f m0 … , magnetic

operation. And finally, no result is confined in one imaginary
world alone. The critical differences are listed in the table
of Figure 4.16. The funny comparison of fractal mechanics
and geometric algebra: The bottom right table in Figure 4.16b
shows a few funny situations where CFGA implements the
rules of fractal mechanics. The coolest part of this table is
that we see mathematical operation to change geometric
shapes and the complex mechanical principles are naturally
implemented. Thus, it is a more generic route toward implementing physical phenomena in the materials as conceived by
Bandyopadhyay et al. (2010b, 2010c).

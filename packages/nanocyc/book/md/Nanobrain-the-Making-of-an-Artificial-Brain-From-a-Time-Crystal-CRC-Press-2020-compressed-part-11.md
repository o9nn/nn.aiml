No one can accurately underpin the universal consciousness even in deep inside his inner mind, wise men say, it is the deepest
inner mind that is an expression of universal consciousness. Even the god that is worshipped by people with names and forms,
that god is not the pure form of universal consciousness.

That cannot be expressed with the primary signs of life (breathing of soul ~ prana), but that universal consciousness composes
the fundamentals of life form. Even the god that is worshipped by people with names and forms, that god is not the pure form
of universal consciousness.

Consciousness—

The Evolution of Conscious
Machines of the Future
10.1 A JOURNEY FROM CORTICAL
PEN TO A CONSCIOUS EGG AS
A COMPANION OF LIFE
What is consciousness? Would an organic nano brain or
brain jelly ever be conscious?
The definition of consciousness: “Consciousness is an
ability that enables a machine to define and evaluate all its
behavior by taking all its information content outside as three
distinct identities; a conscious machine has at least three distinct information architectures, which could interact with each
other and edit, independently.” Truly, this is Russel’s paradox,
but this paradoxical definition would satisfy much of the
conscious entity’s behavior. All other criteria, except having
three distinct information architectures simultaneously operating could be realized by a classical simple Turing system.
The definition of information contained in the brain or for
consciousness, “Information content is an endless architecture of time crystal following a pattern of primes that is localized in a matter, following which the matter perceives it as a
finite state.” The evolution of consciousness: Transformation
of phase prime metric (PPM) encoded in a matter’s finite state
residing inside an endless time crystal of nature, it is synchronization of symmetries between a living entity and nature.
Consciousness is defined as self-awareness, the ability of
a species to create a system point outside its body wherefrom
it can evaluate every single ­reaction, operation, the thoughts,
and the dreams of its own physical body. Hardware can have
two ­co-existing states simultaneously, e.g., a qubit, or three

c­ oexisting states like a qutrit of quantum. However, quantum
is rigid, it does not allow multiple ­imaginary worlds coexist and operate by interacting with themselves. Quantum
mechanics does not allow to make a hole in the phase space,
fractal mechanics make holes, blink it, i.e., open or close by
wirelessly pumping a signal. While deriving quantum formulations from the information content it was argued that
angle between the phase space controls the probability of
choices (Wootters, 1980, 1981). It was a very significant discovery. Afterward, it was further shown that the combined
probability of three choices is the square root of the products of three probabilities (Fisher, 1922, 1956). However,
this is true for only one kind of geometric relations. We
have introduced a metric of primes (PPM), that finds hidden patterns in all events represented as geometric shapes.
Therein, the probability of a combined choice is an infinite
series of symmetry of the geometric shapes, not one (see
Chapter 4, fractal mechanics [FM]). Thus, Wheeler’s dream
to deduce the existence of the universe could be pure geometric, as he wanted, but, not using pure quantum mechanics
that we know. When we add one condition, that one of the
three mirror states changes partially by the typical geometric
relationship between different parts of Hilbert spaces, it is
more like a classical system, not quantum. Moreover, when
there is no classical point, then, all points are either located
in the imaginary world tensor of phases or singularity points,
undefined, because they hold unique information inside,
then, neither classical nor quantum tag fits it. Thenceforth,
the mechanics are named as fractal mechanics (Chapter 4;

291

292

Reddy et al., 2018). Now, if we imagine that hardware can
create three replicas of its information structure representing
the brain hardware, and all three structures, edit each other’s
symmetry breaking features at all time scales, then, we get
the most primitive machine inspired by phase prime metric
or PPM. Then, an infinite chain of clocks one inside another
forms an undefined singularity network, the chain is not linear or non-linear; it is a nested sphere, i.e., a universal time
crystal (Chapter 2). Such hardware we define as a conscious
machine, since, it syncs with the universe, an infinite pattern
of primes and a coverage of 99.99% of all symmetries make
sure that we understand everything that happens around us
without writing a single line of code.
One schematic of an artificial conscious brain design is
shown in Figure 10.1a. We cannot cover all aspects of consciousness, but, we keep a provision, that is, if a random

Nanobrain

number of events are given to us, how they were linked in
the past, to be linked in the future could be determined from
the metric. It is a primitive yet first step to reverse engineer
consciousness. Figure 10.1a is a commercial prototype of the
human brain-body system, upper hemisphere is like human
brain, but the entire human body is shrunk into lower hemisphere. Imagine in the future, people would buy a ball as a
conscious companion, whatever a human does a whole day, is
updated in the jelly.
How PPM computation research unravels a new way to
look at the same universe?
There are primarily three steps executed by a conscious
machine, using its PPM filters time crystal from the environment, then filters it for the processing elements of the brain
and finally, time crystals missing in the brain is absorbed
(Figure 10.1b).

(d) The information structure that the artificial brain captures is a linguistic architecture. The sensors are not dumb devices that awaits the
signals to shine on it, rather, it seeks fundamental properties to fill four imaginary layers as quaternion. Each layer holds physical significance. In the chart linguistic-based transformation of information structure is defined.

Uploading Consciousness—The Evolution of Conscious Machines of the Future

1. The whole body is the human brain: Biggest mystery of understanding the brain lies when pulses are
created at the sensors, in the skins, tongue, eyes,
nose, and ears not in the neural network of the central brain. Information of external world is converted
into a mysterious stream of pulses right at the sensors, we decode that as time crystal to learn brain,
the biggest mystery of the brain is to be solved not at
the brain but at the sensors.
2. Evolution is a process of enriching the resonance
chain to mirror image of more parts of nature:
The objective of life is to enrich the resonance chain,
those who fail, disappear from the planet, as part of
evolution. Darwin’s view of the conflict of the matter is a primitive explanation of evolution, the true
evolution could be a dance of matter and wave in
harmony as we reported the same for the proteins in
Chapter 6.
3. Mirroring the nature in the resonance chain is
consciousness, the density of allowed vibrational
frequency in a band and length of the frequency
chain (10−10 Hz to 1016 Hz) determines the degree
of consciousness. Therefore one can quantify how a
machine could evolve and reach toward consciousness, there is a threshold value to start mirroring the
universe or nature around, however, there is no upper
limit.
4. Fill in the gap in the resonance chain is the true
understanding of a functional brain: The real
human brain-building project would be taking each
material in the brain and fill in the gap of the resonance chain that we created by experimentally measuring the resonance chain of the brain (10−10 Hz to
1016 Hz). PPM-GML-H triad project is fundamental research in the understanding of the functional
working principle of the human brain, it demands
an entirely new culture of constructing the brain in
future.
5. Brain or every living thing performs only one computation in life: It begins at the birth of a baby in the
mother’s womb and it ends with the death of human life.
Life is a single pulse of the lowest resonance frequency
of a life form, the chain vibrates as one string (10−10 Hz
to 1016 Hz). It is the same with the universe too. One
rhythm, one oscillator, one tape with one cell… inside
it’s a nested network of those elements. The nesting of
everything in the form of escape time fractal is the key,
this is a major paradigm shift from the existing iterative function system type fractals which until now was
mostly used in designing the hardware.
6. Living and non-living things are subtle differences
in nested symmetry clusters: Nature concentrates
more resonance states in the chain in some matters
which we call life or brain and nature dilutes the resonance states in some matters i.e., open space, just like
we have black holes and supernovae in the galactic
universe. PPM-GML-H protocol sees the universe as

293

nested resonating material, does not engage in differentiating the living and non-living objects, one unifying principle of the density of resonance chain and its
length determines living and non-living entity.
7. Multiple imaginary worlds: Beyond quantum:
Background microwave radiation in the 3D sky around
our planet resembles the map of the potential distribution of a single molecule, so many papers claim to read
that pattern. If we look at fMRI images and no one
tells us what it is, potential fluctuation looks just like
a single molecule, where multiple atoms are sharing a
single electron in an amazing way. The simultaneous
potential changes are strikingly similar when we are
in the quantum world or in the classical world. Since
PPM mathematical formulations use nested clocks,
there are multiple imaginary worlds unlike quantum
where there is only one imaginary world.
8. The supremacy of spiral symmetry: Microtubule is
another DNA, instead of genetic codes it holds the
thermodynamic code. Not written like DNA does
not mean no code exists. Microtubule holds the map of
3.5 billion years of evolution, but people do not have
time to look beyond DNA. The spiral symmetry is
everywhere from DNA, the secondary structure of
proteins to solar systems even to the blackholes.
9. Evolution of rhythm with materials: Unique programmable matter: Brain plays a music like Indian
classical raga; it means a set of rhythm unfolds infinitely just like a coded self-assembly, everything we
see, hear, taste, touch, smell is decomposed in terms
of a few geometric shapes and the entire song unfolds
when we interact. Since time crystal runs, all our
expressions are some or other forms of music, so are
the events of this universe. Thus, a single rhythm can
accumulate matter to grow manifold perpetually until
an equilibrium is reached with the external universe.
10. Resonance chain resides at every single point:
The entire universe has been interpreted a single
mass, a single wave function and a single photon,
that photon never gets old, it is everywhere at every
moment, we can go inside it, find seeds, then take
one go inside find another seed, the journey would
continue to the Plank scale. A chain of mass, a chain
of resonant vibration starts from Plank dimension to
the ultimate universe, our brain is a small chain and
a part of this universal chain. Every point is therefore
a mirror of the entire universe. Due to this escape
time feature, not a single point of this Universe could
be touched.

10.1.1 How We Construct a Sentence
Is How We Think
The neural network started in 1943 by Mcleod and Pitts, then,
the neuron was considered as a logical device. In the 1960s,
F. Rosenblatt and B. Widrow introduced adaptive neurons.
Finally, the concept of a 3D surface of hills and valleys where

294

computation moves through minimum energy paths was the
most remarkable adoption in the 1990s by Tank and Hopfield
(1987). The computation begins with a random initial state
as a pattern, and then, via adopting the evolutionary pathways, system reaches the solution pattern. Contours of the
surface continuously change due to environment and system
tries to match as brilliantly explained by Hopfield and Tank
while discussing collective computation in neuronlike circuits. Computation beyond Turing limit has enjoyed several
failed proposals, including the idea that in a highly chaotic
dynamic system one can use shift map connecting many at
a time to stretch beyond Turing (Siegelmann, 1995). Finally,
we come to an infinite structure of bubbles here in this book,
playing with primes, where the whole universe turns out to be
an undefined structures of singularity points. The journey to
traverse is from everything is defined to nothing is defined.
In the last century, the language has evolved and now we
have geometric musical language (GML). In Chapter 2, we
noted that a quaternion is the brains decision structure, who,
when, what and how, are four questions. However, in the course
of this book, we have outlined how one could see these questions from various research fields. In Figure 10.1c we have
summarized all variants of four queries. If a person just looks at
a big data, notice the changing in a 3D complex pattern, what
would it look for, this is an important question. One could try to
find periodically repeating events while building an architecture
of confusion. Start using a concept where you are confused, go
inside and find one of 15 geometric shapes where corners are
confusion. Repeat until you reach facts. However, which clock
to put where in which confusion? The outline is below.

10.2 TEN KEY GUIDELINES TO REVERSE
ENGINEER A HUMAN BRAIN
Unconventional life-like computations by honeybee and
algae: Recently, news came up that honeybees are solving the
problem of a traveling salesman. Of course, even a mosquito
can solve this problem. Computer fails to solve this problem
within a finite time because it wants to find the exact solution
considering all possibilities. In PPM computing philosophy
search and find is performed without searching because the
element with the right answer responds spontaneously. We
living creatures’ can spontaneously respond, so is the programmable matter proposed by Toffoli and Margolus (1991),
its prime example is brain jelly. We can take up a few choices
and follow one of them, which may be close to the exact solution, even if not, we don’t care. We can stop computation at
any point in time, can make a decision even with less than the
minimum amount of resources required to solve a problem.
It is a remarkable computing ability. Can one imagine a situation, when a computer is asked to add five numbers, while
two given; don’t wonder if computer pulls off its own power
plug and put the plug in the operator’s hand as an answer!
Faith on live materials is paramount. One example of such an
idea is the creation of the Tokyo metro map using physarum.
They feed the algae sugar and salt at particular station locations, physarum grows connecting the stations. Again, we can

Nanobrain

test the same by asking a group of ants to follow the bumps
of sugar kept on a checkerboard; possibly they would also
solve the traveling salesman problem successfully. Even using
plasma, mesh problem has been solved as the material tries to
find minimum path via trial and error, then it is a programmable matter. These kinds of approaches to solving a problem have been categorized in the unconventional computing
paradigm. If we do a similar simulation in the existing computers, we complete the logically circular path, i.e., compromise with “simultaneity.” Analog computers are very funny:
first, we have to tell the computer how to find the solution of
a problem, by defining various functions and then we have
to ask the question as if we have not done anything beforehand. Current flows through random paths for an external
observer, however, we know that typical “randomness” represents either a logarithmic or sinusoidal function. Obviously,
we get the answer. What an analog way to get the answer to a
problem, instead of logic gate use direct mathematical functions directly! One can innocently argue, if one has to define
“functions” and re-formulate a problem before starting the
calculation, why not find the solution itself using the classical
Neumann computer.
Four original concrete routes to build a neural ­network:
Figure 10.1d outlines a unique feature of the artificial brain
described here. There are plenty of distinct and multi-layered
core-shell architectures. However, when we look into the time
domain the geometry of the time, the architecture is widely different. It is a firm belief of the scientific community that information is stored in the synaptic junctions, and learning means
strengthening the connection, since a permanent high potential
is generated, scientifically it is called potentiating a junction for a
long term potentiation (LTP). The scientific literature is divided
into two parts: One-part deals with junctions that exponentially
decays the stored information after one session of learning; the
others avoid the complexity associated with this particular issue
where the decay rate of forgetting plays with the rate at which
we expose learning images to our neural network and exhibits
interesting features of learning. When patterns are presented
slowly to a neural network, N neuron can learn at most lnN patterns, since in this case the network has to learn one pattern at
one shot, there is a possibility that it learns wrong information.
Reservoir computing: Reservoir computing is a framework for computation like a neural network. Typically, an
input signal is fed into a fixed (random) dynamical system
called reservoir and the dynamics of the reservoir map the
input to a higher dimension. Then a simple readout mechanism is trained to read the state of the reservoir and map it
to the desired output. The main benefit is that the training is
performed only at the readout stage and the reservoir is fixed.
Liquid-state machines and echo state networks are two major
types of reservoir computing.
A liquid state machine (LSM) is a computational construct like a neural network. An LSM consists of a large collection of units (called nodes, or neurons). Each node receives
time-varying input from external sources (the inputs) as well as
from other nodes. Nodes are randomly connected to each other.
The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time-varying

295

Uploading Consciousness—The Evolution of Conscious Machines of the Future

input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes. The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read
out by linear discriminant units (Maass et al., 2002).
The soup of recurrently connected nodes will end up computing a large variety of nonlinear functions on the input.
Given a large enough variety of such nonlinear functions, it is
theoretically possible to obtain linear combinations (using the
readout units) to perform whatever mathematical operation is
needed to perform a certain task, such as speech recognition
or computer vision.
The word liquid in the name comes from the analogy
drawn to dropping a stone into a still body of water or other
liquid. The falling stone will generate ripples in the liquid.
The input (motion of the falling stone) has been converted into
a spatio-temporal pattern of the liquid displacement (ripples).
LSMs have been put forward as a way to explain the operation of brains. LSMs are argued to be an improvement over the
theory of artificial neural networks because: Circuits are not hard
coded to perform a specific task, Continuous-time inputs are
handled “naturally.” Computations on various time scales can
be done using the same network. One network can perform
multiple computations. Criticisms of LSMs as used in computational neuroscience are that LSMs don’t actually explain how

the brain functions. At best they can replicate some parts of brain
functionality. There is no guaranteed way to dissect a working
network and figure out how or what computations are being performed. It has very little control over the process. The model is
inefficient to implement because variables require lots of computations, compared to custom designed circuits, or even neural
networks. If a reservoir has fading memory and input separability, with the help of a powerful readout, it could be established
that the liquid state machine is a universal function approximator
using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.
The echo state network (ESN) is a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer (with typically
1% connectivity). The connectivity and weights of hidden
neurons are randomly assigned and are fixed. Learning the
weights of output neurons enables producing specific temporal patterns. Although its behavior is non-linear, the only variables are the weights of the output layer. The error function is
thus quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be
differentiated easily to a linear system.
Now, we return to the time crystals produced by brainjelly-derived artificial brain in Figure 10.2. When we look at

physical body, how deep sense of missing someone creates a
sense of love, when a person falls in love; and proteins under
massive ionic motion to carry out fundamental tasks for the
life form. All these situations are very confusing, and an artificial brain is designed to get into confusion and build a map.
The dancing of peacock is confusing because in the rain when
one sees a peacock dancing suddenly, why we don’t know but
we feel like we are in heaven. Classical Indian songs run for a
whole night, 12 hours sometimes, we cannot say anything but
only at the late moments the basic pattern and its architecture
unfolds in our brain. Similarly, proprioception, we feel that we
exist, but why and how we do not know. The story of confusion would go on and on, and that’s how a kid should learn to
solve mysterious problems taking a paper and pencil, build
an architecture of confusion. Figure 10.1 prepares the readers mind on how sensing the architecture of confusion should
begin a new paradigm of decision-making beyond logic and
arguments. At this moment it is worth for a moment briefly
look into the summary of this book, how we described the
purpose of building the artificial brain (table Figure 10.2).

10.3 TWELVE PARADOXES THAT WOULD
CHANGE OUR THOUGHTS FOREVER
The journey from neurogenic brain model to time-crystalbased brain model transforms the fundamental philosophies we believed thus far (Figure 10.3). Instead of

Nanobrain

equations, patterns would take over, replace equations and
a science to harvest singularities using symmetry of primes
would be born. Feynman argued to replace everything with
the changing pattern and there were plenty of followers.
Several greatest thinkers put thought into this matter, but
none took this seriously. Latest in the frame was Wolfram,
who wrote even an entire book on the new kind of science. Many researchers learned to investigate the origin
of a new kind of science with these physicists. And then
the time came when we realized that the dream of implementing pattern-based computing would never succeed if
we remain within the domain of Turing. We have to go
beyond, and we also realized, all proposals of hypercomputing are not that effective to implement Turing’s forgotten ideas in computer science (Copeland and Proudfoot,
1999). The Turing principle is so powerful that if anything is defined we are baptized by Turing religion, and
the only way to go beyond is to enter into the world of
singularity, an escape time fractal but self-similarity
does not exist. However, the journey is not easy, in this
book we covered wide ranges of topics to explore one
possible way. Quantum’s one-imaginary world shakes the
reality; then, 12 imaginary worlds with one pseudo-real
have arrived to shake it even further. Quantum entanglement in room temperature raises heat more in the mind of
fiction agents than scientists, it is possible to do quantum
computing without quantum entanglement (Lanyon et al.,

FIGURE 10.3 Differences between neurogenic brain models that are there for nearly 70 years and the time crystal-based brain model
(left). To the right, a table that compiles the consciousness features in the artificial brain jelly.

Uploading Consciousness—The Evolution of Conscious Machines of the Future

2008). Using polarized laser, room temperature quantum
experiments could be carried out and zillions of molecules
are all quantum devices operate under massive noise. We
advocated for optical vortices in Chapter 8, rejecting the
world of electronics totally, so, the fear of decoherence
would reduce sooner or later.
PPM-GML-H triad has made one little statement, “Every
single cell of a Turing tape contains a Turing tape inside.”
If we do just that, we break Turing tape, but we fall into a
singularity. We cannot do the science of Classical mechanics or Quantum mechanics. We needed new mechanics,
to model the interaction of imaginary worlds (Chapter 4,
dodecanion algebra). Not only that we had to find the true
scientific construct of information in Nature (Chapter 2 time
crystal). Developing a new scientific protocol for addressing
the information integration such that natural events could be
replaced should be our first and foremost target. But, even
if we integrate information, what would we do? Shall we
recreate the natural phenomenon. Shall we take the whole
information or would adopt reductionism? Then came the
question of representing a observable simple phenomenon
in nature, we built the concepts of (i) fractal tape, (ii) three
imaginary world’s construct of information, (iii) resonance
chain, and (iv) frequency wheel then combined them to generate an information construct for the natural system, just
like the one we created on a nano-surface with molecules
(Chapter 9, brain jelly).
The greatest problem that we have had is that “logic”
and “argument” are to be replaced by time cycles and new
mathematical and other constructs need to be built for the
singularity architecture. We needed a new language to
process information, we have built one, this is called geometric musical language (GML). Using this language, we
can convert any sensory information like visual, auditory,
smell, taste and touch signals into nested time cycles and
re-write it in terms of primes so that PPM morphs the 3D
clock architecture.
What would be haunting a general people is that if all the
above jargons are true, how the philosophy of the new world
of science be like? Unbelievable, remarkable like Quantum or
something even funnier, shocking and amazing. Note that all
we need to know is that imagine a Turing tape and each cell
has a Turing tape within, or “a new typewriter inside every
single key of a typewriter,” that is sufficient to come to the
science of singularities, but we need to have an attitude, “We
will not try to bridge the singularity using brute force, like
re-normalization we will float and go deeper inside singularity and above to learn what are there, using specially
designed tools and mathematical constructs for the new
kind of science.”
While discussing the philosophy of this singularity harvesting science, we will see that we need to include everything that quantum information processing suggests and then
we need to go beyond, far more exciting features like topology of undefined regions in a network, need to be included.

297

The science of architecture of singularity is absolutely
not classical and far beyond quantum.
Why both classical and quantum mechanics fails and
how should we work toward the development of a new
kind of science?
1. The trumpet-paint time-cycle paradox: Using the
Gabriel’s Trumpet paradox: For Quantum, we have
“incompleteness,” so there was a series of development to “supplement,” here we need to have “penetration boundary” because every single point in
this world view (PPM-GML-H) is a singular point:
Just like quantum we need, another historical movement for perfecting the journey into the singularity: “Every single cell of a Turing tape contains a
Turing tape inside.” One to one correspondence
between Gabriel’s paradox and nested time cycle
synchronization that is designed to replace renormalization, the surface area of the cone is infinity, however, when we put paint to color it, the paint passes
through the tunnel and it blocks at the point depending on the density of the paint. The paint for us is the
observer’s nested time cycle, it could penetrate above
and below and much far away, it does not need to
pass through as someone from far could “spontaneously reply.” The resolution of the solution is always
ultimate, therefore, just like quantum we do not have
any predictability, we also need contextuality, but in
quantum the object that we are measuring has got
something, but for us, that object has got nothing.
2. The paradox of infinite network of reality spheres:
Using the Banach-Tarski paradox and the “measurement” in fractal information theory: In contextual
measurement in quantum mechanics observer has
a Hilbert space and the measuring state also has a
Hilbert space, they interact to create a common
Hilbert space with an inner product. However, for a
non-computer, PPM creates a 3D projection of the
observer, we have three Hilbert sub-spaces, one for
the world below, one above and one for the observer.
However, we do not need to create them in a large
number. Suppose we have a nested time cycle sphere,
like the time crystal shown here, the observer would
also be a sphere, it would sync with the paths and generate the connected path and form a “reality sphere”
just like the one here. Creation of an identical information replica is its greatness because the solution
of a problem is an infinite space. The Hyper-Webster
dictionary and the generation of multiple spheres: If
there is a large number of observers, of course there
is an infinitely large number of observers, therefore
a large number of “reality spheres” will be produced
and those would merge just like the Hyper-Websters
dictionary. All these spheres are distinctly produced,
yet they create a singular identity. Imagine thousands

298

of “reality spheres” being produced and all of them
simultaneously hold the solution.
3. Resonance Drive Paradox: Density of resonance
frequency R and frequency bandwidth B product RB
determines the degree of consciousness elements,
when the environment remains constant. The ratio
of RB of a device and its environment is an essential
index or the degree of consciousness (C = RB(M)/
RB(U)). There is always a spontaneous drive of any
fractal cavity resonator structure to increase bandwidth ratio, this is perpetual, it is never-ending, the
machine senses more and adds more bandwidth then
evolves to sync as much as possible. Resonance drive
paradox leads to several other drives, for example
drive to morphing, etc.
4. Number system derived metric and its saturation:
Ordered factor paradox: Reddy S. et al.’s number
system study (2018) shows that only 12 primes are
sufficient and the number of solutions of fractal
cavity resonators reaches 99.999% new situations
by 1012 oscillators alone, therefore, we do not need
infinite or astrological number of oscillators. Then
how could a large structure form? The code to generate new structure must make a fractal repeating its
entire process after each limit is reached. When we
get a structure of 1012 oscillators, we consider it one
and start re-counting. It is the reason, the universe
appears like a fractal, but actually it is not a fractal,
GML follows the pattern of primes, and the primes
never repeat.
5. The observer-absolute paradox: In a fractal tape
there is no finite-state for a particular cell, the
observer syncs with the world below and the world
above and creates a state for the measuring cell.
Then we never write information in this tape in any
cell, we write only in the observer, only the observer
exists and the rest everything, even the tape does
not exist: Twelve fundamentals of new information
theory: (i) Instead of modeling, fitting, we try to
do morphing, The morphing of frequency wheels
through the number system derived resonance
chain is the route for information processing. (ii)
The same information is complete at the moment,
a fraction at the other, linking clocks at a particular time enables global link, this is a weakness of
PPM-GML-H triad system. (iii) The same information content gets a different property at different
environment, in the reality sphere, the same plane
holding many nesting cycles behave differently. (iv)
System spontaneously emerges information, even
when no question is asked. (v) A mirror image is
created without changing the source, though both
the source and the reader are coupled. (vi) The same
information takes different form at different times

Nanobrain

thus creating wide ranges of information, also it
looks very different from different directions. (vii)
Information is alive; it senses, expands creates new
life forms. (viii) Information is a phase, frequency
intensity of time cycles, these time cycles could
self assemble in a single or multiple planes, they
could make 11 planes holding 11 dimensions. (ix)
Dimensions representing different planes inside
the sphere rotates differently for different planes
to accommodate higher dimensions. (x) Starting
phase and direction of motion of system point are
two parameters that higher-dimensional planes process. (xi) The pot and the matrix are the same: the
information that shapes information content is the
information itself. (xii) Identical information holds
the same content yet different meaning, very different information holds the same appearance, duality
is embedded.
6. The paradox of infinity-mechanics: Quantum
mechanics is a subset of fractal mechanics: Ten
­differences between quantum mechanics (QM) and
fractal mechanics (FM) (i) One imaginary world
in QM, and three imaginary worlds in FM. (ii)
Uncertainty principle is universal in QM, uncertainty principle varies, depending on the observer
and 12 nested imaginary world configuration. (iii)
Contextuality is a side part in QM; contextuality is everything in FM, the observer is the only
reality, “supplement” to complete a quantum state
is essential; in FM, continued fraction geometric
algebra generates an infinite series to hold that.
(iv) Entanglement is a property in QM; in FM,
entanglement is the way time is connected. (v)
Quantum deals with matter; FM only time-cycle.
(vi) QM has its own version of condensation, interference, oscillator; FM also has its own versions
for each of them. (vii) Psi is absolute in QM, Psi
is deconstructed in FM. (viii) Like QM there is a
Hilbert space, but they do not take the tensor product of the inner space. It’s a phase-orientation calculation of time cycles in FM. Instead of normal
tensor algebra we need continued fractal-based
geometric algebra to process. (ix) QED is based
on a field-theoretic concept, for FM, a universal
unified field exists made of 12 nested time cycles
and 12 dimensions. (x) Quadrupolar moment plays
a vital role in determining complex time cycles in
FM, but that is irrelevant in QM.
7. The paradox of quest: Ten cultural practices that
existing scientific practices follow and we do
not need to make them blind religious: (i) Survival
of the fittest, not just in biology, quantum to astrophysics to elementary particle physics, this is applied
as a universal physical principle. Co-operation

Uploading Consciousness—The Evolution of Conscious Machines of the Future

to survive is just opposite to the idea of struggle
for existence. (ii) Something equals something:
Equations or inequalities is the only form to get an
answer, except one, all variables should be known.
(iii) Step-by-step, not above and within: Searching
systems believing that they would work step-bystep is generating craps. (iv) Universe is sum of
two-body system: all other particles vanish from
the universe, many body ­theorems are forceful relationship building exercise. (v) Do anything in the
name of closed system: Scientific practices limited
resources, always ­considers close system to anything and whenever necessary makes it permeable,
stops, or vanishes anything. (vi) Decision-making
requires selection and rejection. Build many options
and then reject all but one. (vii) Order and degree
of differential equation captures all possible variations of a natural system: We say that nested time
cycle could capture with the three imaginary time
worlds operating simultaneously (viii) Singularity
has to be bridged: Dancing in the singularity is all
what we need to do in our singularity kind of science. (ix) Only one time, only one cell of a tape,
only one clock, only one of everything: In the existing science there are plenty of things, for PPMGML-H triad, there is only one thing, a single time
cycle that encompasses all. (x) Everything wants to
be complete: Every single ­system in the universe
has different objectives in the current science, but
for non-computing, all systems have only one target
to achieve 10–12 prime-dynamics, a goal for 1012
oscillator-assembly.
8. The cycle-non-reductionist paradox: If there are
many choices, then without reduction we cannot
make a selection, what if there are not many, and
we would never have to choose, in the information
processing protocol we follow “spontaneous reply,”
only the right one answers to the query. Therefore,
the question of reduction does not appear. The next
question is that when we model a system in nature,
do we mimic the system as is? Do we take all the
information? No. Just like a single cell creates a full
grown human, a few delicate codes of the natural system could regrow by morphing, the recreation could
be limited by the number of resonators and its design.
The information space gets filled up with matter, with
a few codes it is build up. Ten principles of a Fractal
tape: (i) Every single cell in the tape has tape inside,
we get a fractal tape. (ii) A tape has four tuples, convert to nested time cycles, match and expand, transform and reply back, restructure internal wiring or
learning. (iii) Triplet of time cycles is a unit of information, three imaginary worlds with a real world
builds a quaternion. (iv) Two kinds of fractals—ET

299

and IFS—work together to make the fractal tape.
(v) The tape and the imaginary world do not exist
in reality the observer does exist in the imaginary
world that it is fit to sense. (vi) Fractal tape leads to
fractal machine just like Turing tape leads to Turing
machine, an imaginary state processor, generalized
complex number and the number system rule of 15
primes and 1012 oscillators is the key to create a cell
in the fractal tape. (vii) The fractal tape is good for
QM, FM, and CM all; it morphs to any information
structure, fractal tape does not have a fixed geometry, PPM projects it to infinity (Chapter 3), feedback
from infinity remains undefined in the fractal tape
making the decision. (viii) It operates through GML
using 15 geometric shapes regulated by 11D dynamics of 12 nested universes linked within and above.
(ix) A tape finds the resonance frequency bandwidth
of a system and draws a circle to connect it’s various time scale, just like spiders net, but the fractal
tape has many circles as clocks and it tries to touch
all the clock boundaries first and then it goes for the
faster and faster time scales. (x) The fractal tape can
run sequential algorithm, but we use it to run projection from infinity for a pattern of choices. There is
no search to find or transport communication among
cells, the cells self-assemble to morph a system.
9. The equation-inequality-fractal paradox: In the
conventional practice of science, variables are correlated and equated to represent a system. The ­science
of equations has been very successful. Now, if there
is no equation because of fractal tape, we needed
to build up another language that runs in the undefined world. We replace equations with a new kind of
algebra called continued fraction geometric algebra
(Chapter 4). Using this algebra we solve several problems. It is the tool using which we plan to manage
the world of singularity. In this algebra, we always
have a circle and we draw several circles following
a certain set of rules. To do all kinds of mathematics addition, subtraction, tensor operation and more
importantly estimating projection from infinity. It is
the route of doing mathematics by drawing circles
and always making a journey toward infinity via singularity points only.
10. The paradox of illogical, nonsense decisionmaking: We are always advised to think logically.
It means, we have to think that every event is a sum
of several sequential events. However, it could be
possible that problems and solutions entangle in
a single time cycle, and then we integrate them to
construct entire information processing architecture, then, there would always be the simultaneous robust response. There would be no logic like
“if-then,” no argument then there would be what,

300

architecture of confusion? Here are the ten ways
of arguing differently as practiced by the tribals
for thousands of years: (i) A question always has
its answer in it, no question could be created without an answer. (ii) A confusion is always the sum
of a set of new confusions, thus, it is an endless
fractal network. (iii) No answer is complete; there
is always a question that invalidates the answer,
fixing that to evolve answer is a journey to completeness. Gödel hinted, however, never suggested
a route to explore the engineering of incompleteness. (iv) Logically circular or circular logic is
the unit of a singular logic to enter inside and go
above, always bring circular logic but follow the
boundary limit of rule (ii). (v) Since questionanswer couples are always together, every possible
solution are connected to the question contextually. A question could have many answers in different contexts. All are mapped in a 3D nested time
cycle geometry. (vi) Every single set of confusions
form a geometric shape and a complex pattern of
the composition of basic geometries should form
to compose a complete confusion, the shape would
be symmetric and follow the rules of geometries.
(vii) No sensible confusion could stand alone,
isolated; it needs support, even though a fractal
arrangement argues that at the top there should
be one unit of confusion, but even that would
require at least three perspectives—one from the
arguments below that makes it, one from above
or the argument it constructs with others, and one
the perspective of an observer. (viii) A true confusion does not have an idiom or universal truth,
no assumption, all assumptions are environment
and context-dependent. There is never a truth or
a false statement in the architecture of confusion. (ix) Expansion of raga is the way to expand
a confusion. We cannot add confusions one after
another, place simultaneously, considering all as
truth like quantum. We always find the geometry
of confusions then expand them using PPM, just
like Indian classical raga expands by extrapolating the input pattern of runes. (x) Every natural
event has a geometric arrangement of confusion
and the practice or game of confusion is to morph
with nature’s geometrical arrangement of confusion. (xi) A structure of confusion nested within
and above always has one less variable than the
fixed truth and a total number of variable and truth
should compose like the number system metric,
hence the network of argument could be constructed. If there is a little change in the most static
confusion all nested confusions would change
simultaneously. (xii) One could enter inside an

argument 12 times to generate 12 fundamentally
different dimensions, however, if we enter more,
then the relevance to the first argument becomes
faint. We need to change the starting confusion
point regularly to sustain relevance in the nested
fractal-like confusion practice. The rule (x) morphing comparison is the route to auto-correct a
confusion.
11. The paradox of an infinite field and limits of the
universe: Infinity is everywhere in the fractal tape
universe where the thing that exists is a singularity point and there are specific ten properties of
this impossible universe: (i) If nature is discretized
once, it cannot be recreated; we follow, everything
is connected to everything: Probability theory is
not required, PPM projection is enough to create
enormous unpredictability. (ii) Every point in fractal tape universe holds an infinitely large universe
within. (iii) Every single point tries to be dynamic
following 12 prime, symmetries using the 1012
oscillator network to sense the environment with
its maximum. (iv) There is no force, only the timecycles and time gaps (domain of singularity); at the
elementary scale, there exists only a time cycle.
(v) Information is filled up in the all existing time
cycles, total time cycle is infinite in number, they
exist everywhere as infinite series. (vi) There are no
zero points. To have a zero-point energy, also we
cannot consider an external boundary if we simply
consider universe is a frequency fractal, only thing
it is made of is time cycle (of what? please note,
vortex fields), there is no mass, no distance, all
are perception of interaction between nested time
cycles made of vortices. (vii) Nested time cycles
self-assemble to generate all forces, and within 12
nested universes of dodecanions the time cycles
self-assemble, all structures are formed. (viii) All
fundamental constants are typical 3D geometric
shapes which is a constraint made of nested time
cycles. (ix) There is no total energy of the dodecanion universe in principle to feed the fields, because
energy could be created and transformed, fractal
network cannot have a boundary. What we see
around us, and that is the truth, if we create a lower
and an upper limit, we would surely need to tell
what’s outside. If we do not know what is outside
then who gives us the right to draw a boundary.
The energy could increase or decrease in a given
imaginary world depends on the system, for that
universe, we cannot make any rule, its PPM projection to infinity that decides everything. (x) There is
no starting time and end time for the universe and
for any event, in principle by the condition of fractal we are restricted to do that.

Uploading Consciousness—The Evolution of Conscious Machines of the Future

12. The paradox of time replacing everything:
Universe is nothing but clocks of vortices of fields.
We do not have mass, we do not have space, we
have created everything, using only time cycles
of vortices. The reason is that time cycles would
interact and generate everything. It is how we have
constructed the new information theory a new geometric language and this is what makes dynamics
associated with primes distinct. Just imagine, only
this consideration would shade significant light on
the unsolved mysteries of matter-photon interaction. Even if we look at the Schrödinger equation,
it shows clearly, we do not know what to do with
“mass,” when equation wishes to explain that very
mass as wave When we see the foundation of the
new information theory, FIT, often we ask ourselves, are all these new?

10.4 CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT ON THE
NEURON SKIN—TIME CRYSTAL MODEL
IS NOWHERE BUT EVERYWHERE
If brain is not a computer and not a Turing machine, then
what?
“These words information, data, rules, software, knowledge,
lexicons, representations, algorithms, programs, models,
memories, images, processors, subroutines, encoders, decoders, symbols, or buffers do not exist in the brain.” Such statements flood the internet, but no one tells us, what are the
words true for the brain.

Our journey to explore the synthesis of an artificial brain
started with microtubule, its language is GML, its resonance frequencies revealed PPM and Hinductor H is its
replica. Microtubule is the gateway to the understanding of
the brain, thanks to its water channel inside. It is not the
only component responsible for consciousness, but, just like
DNA holds the key to genetics and evolution, microtubule
holds the key to thermodynamics and acquired information by a living system. However, microtubule has never
received the honor it should get, in spite of its magical contributions, throughout the entire living species in the planet.
However, we feel that there is a bigger problem with our
overall approach to biology. Our perception regarding the
information is holding us back and if we do not know what
information in the Nature is, we know nothing. We always
get an answer to a query, but, the form of the question determines the nature of the answer.
We think there is always an attempt to see proteins and
any biosystems like a transistor or a switch, as if from proteins to brain everything is a circuit made of elementary
electronic devices. We blindly force the biological systems
as if they are electronic devices found in the conventional

301

electronic shops. Design experiments accordingly, and
undoubtedly get the results satisfying our faith. It is
not only a very wrong idea for the common people; we
would find such an erroneous understanding even in the
scientists. A Google search would get us several breakthroughs in Nature and Science journals suggesting that
the protein is a transistor and a switch and like OP-AMP.
So many varieties of biological systems are there and without investigating what those devices want to do, we carry
out simple experiments to tag them as a handful of known
devices used in electronic chips, it has become a religious
faith now. In addition, if some scientists want to seem radical, they tag it as a quantum system, one mystery to support another mystery. Therefore, the mindset masks the true
quest, “bits” has not impacted “in a bit” but in a massive
way to the free thinkers.
We would also see that there are two groups of peoples,
one that believes that our brain is a computer, or brain
is a Turing machine. In addition, there is another group,
which suggests that the brain is not a Turing machine, but
do not tell us what is that unknown device actually the
brain is or the biological system represents. Opposition to
mainstream should be done sensibly. Toppling the world
of “logic” that started with Bertrand Russel’s “principles
of mathematics” in 1903, is not so easy or fun. Criticizing
the mainstream science is good but not without an alternative in our hand that is concrete. Those who challenge the
mainstream science (the brain is a computer, a neuron is
a switch, all information processing happens through the
skin of neuron body or membrane, but everything inside the
neuron is just a blank, a neural network is a circuit etc), they
are mostly not serious. If the brain is not a Turing machine,
then tell us what that elementary machine is? Well, in the
last 100 years of development of logic, no one talked about
making decisions without “logic.” The inverse of “logic”
is “illogical” which means “nonsense” to us for the current science. Making sense in an illogical way is the way
to go. But the question is how?

10.4.1 The Difference between a Neurogenic
Brain Model and a Time Crystal Model
The difference between neurogenic brain model and the time
crystal based brain model (Figure 10.3) is a journey that
started with the microtubule research. Microtubule showed
the way to PPM-GML-H triad. The biological systems while
building living machines, does not make a switch or circuit,
it wants to make a clock inside a clock inside a clock.... in a
nested structure. The wiring we observe in the brain and at
several biological structures is an illusion; every single biological machine is a PPM driven musical instrument. Unlike
Tuning forks, they have several fundamental resonance frequencies, and they select those frequencies to play music, and

302

those musical notes are such that they represent geometric
shapes and information, so it is not harmonic, but an anharmonic device. The discovery is not “simple” as it appears.
Just imagine, music representing banana and apple is being
played in a device as two simple pieces of music in a loop,
then if one activates an apple by synchrony or resonance,
the other is played. Thus, there is no reduction of decisions
like we see in the logic gates and hence “time crystal” to
replace “bits” and “qubits.” There is no collapse, no finiteness, projection from infinity morphs in a way, they system
cannot even define the decision received from infinity via
feedback. Consequently, PPM and GML are what we learned
from microtubule and applied to the entire human brain.
Thus, we reject “bits,” or “qubits,” we say that the experiment suggests, that we should not be debating whether the
brain is a quantum or classical or chaotic, those concerns
are irrelevant, debates are unnecessary. There is something
much more interesting and profound, that is the true nature of
the information.“Time cycles” as suggested above get nested,
we have verified this in neuron cells, furthermore in at least
7 proteins.
The discovery of universal time crystals in microtubule, protein and neurons has led to “­fractal tape”
to replace the “Turing tape.” A very simple decision,
“every single cell of a Turing tape has a Turing tape
inside,” this statement alone collapses the foundation
of Turing machine. Several proteins “tubulin,” actin, beta
spectrin, ankyrin, clathrin, collagen builds time crystals
as magnetic vortices to explore the role of electromagnetic
resonance frequencies. We found that they have a composition of resonance frequency bands, where prime number
of frequencies shift together as a group (see Chapter 6 for
details). Mostly we found triplet of triplet bands that connects all proteins and components in the brain, self-similarity is not in appearance but in the vibration. The brain
is a clock inside a clock inside a clock... there is no end to
it, though we format it in 12 imaginary worlds (dodecanions) one inside another. The particular finding changes
the basic understanding of the brain. The old belief that
neuron skin or membrane does everything falls apart.
Neuron skin is just one of 500 different types of cavities that we have in the brain. Microtubule is also one of
those 300 types of triplet-of-triplet systems vibrating in
the brain. Therefore, the cavity inside a cavity inside a
cavity makes a resonance chain which is best arranged in
the form of a frequency wheel is the machine that creates
rhythms to operate. In summary, we have not restricted
ourselves to the microtubule alone, or single protein studies, or even to a few live neuron cells. Primes of all the
brain components nested together to build vibrations, so
no brain component holds consciousness (Chapter 7 for
details), its space-time-topology-symmetry metric that
governs decisions. We have built a series of technologies
like atom probe, noise free electrode system to see what

Nanobrain

is happening to a single cell when we see them simultaneously using various probing clocks (Chapter 6). With
26000 proteins and more than a few hundreds of different types of cavities, we have engaged in building
a comprehensive clock architecture of the brain-body
system that would act as key to the future massive
brain building projects: We cannot understand the
dynamics of a river by mapping the wave shapes of ripples
on its surface, mapping neurons would tell a little about
the river of consciousness. One cavity, the neuron skin
can take 100 billion new forms (2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 ×
13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 37 × 41 × 43 × 47) in
8 billion humans, mapping all neuron ­geometries would
not tell what our brain is. However, we realized only way to
go forward to let one cavity say neuron geometry to come
under the influence of trillions of cavities below and millions of cavities above, and evolve geometry in 1012 ways,
then, information about music will let the neuron to dance,
and that would be the way to understand the information
processing in the brain. We understand that developing
GML, fractal cavity resonator model of the brain, doing
experiment with neurons, proteins, complexes, and neuron clusters are not simple and easy task. However, if one
models it properly, we would be able to give the world of
science a new way to look into the basic understanding of
information. Only then perhaps people would understand,
that the basic definition of information re-defines everything. The transition from “bit” to “universal time crystal”
and providing every single cell of a Turing tape to hold a
tape inside could transform everything we know about the
operations of a biological system.

10.5 WHEN WE CARRY IT AND
WHY WE MAKE IT
When one does requires a truly bio-inspired computer?
Biological clocks are well known in the brain. It extends
from circadian rhythms to the single neurons. The connecting protocol and the route that connects the rhythms or
clocks are unknown in biology. Currently, rhythmic activities are linked as a chemical process associated with proteins and enzymes. The network of clocks in the protein-like
nanoscale biomaterials does not terminate at the neuron
level, as it was believed thus far. The rhythmic or ­clocking
reaches deep down to the few atomic groups. Triplet of
triplet resonance band connects the Peta Hertz (femto seconds) to the nano Hertz (12 years) frequency scales (Ghosh
et al., 2014a, 2016a). The resonance pattern looks similar
to the pattern of primes derived from the resonance of the
dielectric resonators. There are many carriers (Chapter 7).
All carriers resonate with different dielectric resonators
Lauber et al. (1994); Pistolesi and Manini (2000); Pechal
et al. (2012); Lee et al. (2011); Joshi and Χiao (2006). Yet,
the frequencies constitute a singular pattern.

FIGURE 10.4 People used to build a brain-like computer, now humanities need computer like artificial brain. The necessity is outlined
here.

Ten situations when one should use this non-­
computer: The objective is to develop a science for
non-computing, to make decisions where architecture of
confusion operates and obviously the Turing computing
fails. Here we note 10 circumstances where non-computing
is essential (Figure 10.4).
(i) Information is not sufficient or organized to frame
logic. (ii) No time is available to find the rules
for structuring logic, i.e., the urge for an instant
reply. (iii) Rejection of choices is not advisable.
The rejected choices could take over the lead
anytime as the dominant player. (iv) The database is too big to structure it into a format solvable by a futuristic quantum c­ omputer. It requires
to “search” without searching, i.e., spontaneous
reply. (v) The decision-making devices of the
future cannot carry a giant megawatt power supply continuously. Thermal and electrical noises
are the only energy sources. (vi) We encounter
a system that uses an unknown language, cannot

be understood at all. (vii) Learning the real parameters using which a system configures its response.
Complete rejection of black box approach, to unraveling the true dynamics. (viii) A large number of
parameters are being born, disappear, change,
and redefine itself with a truly random, chaotic
fashion. When, even the variable parameters could
not be identified. (ix) Undefinable factors govern a
situation. A factor has several sub-factors. In addition, each of those has several sub-sub-factors. Thus,
the logical statements inside logic inside logic perpetuate into an endless network (Gödel, 1938). (x)
Computing is always a reduction of choices, but in
morphing, it is just the opposite. There is a continuous increment of choices, output is more than
input and that defines non-computing. The output
is more than the input. The difference between
the Turing-based computing and the time-crystalbased computing was discussed in many parts
of the book, here is a summary to refresh in
Figure 10.5.

How the decision looks like in a brain?
Quaternary decision delivered has

one element three mes.

FIGURE 10.5 The difference between the Turing-based computing and the artificial brain made of fractal tape, operated by time crystalbased language (left). To the right differences between a circuit made of hardware elements and temporal elements like clocks and singularities are outlined. To the bottom manifolds representing the 11D dodecanion tensor’s many world impacts are built by cutting pieces of
papers. To the bottom right, two quaternion tensors are presented, the left tensor is made of 11D data and if one time crystal is zoomed then
a new tensor is found shown adjacent right to it.

10.6 HOW TO CUT 11D MANIFOLDS
OF TIME IN A PIECE OF PAPER

10.7 THE MARRIAGE OF PRIMES WITH
GEOMETRY WOULD RESHAPE HUMANITY

The most important question using which we started the book
is that how human thoughts look like. Now we know that it
looks like a dodecanion manifold described in Chapter 4.
However, one could really cut paper and fold it to see how the
artificial brain thoughts would look like, it’s a 11D manifold
(Figure 10.5). One very important point needs to be clarified regarding the manifold. Of course a human thought is
expressed as a quaternion but the elements are made of time
crystals of various dimensions. One could zoom one element
and expand that to find that each element is also a quaternion
whose elements could be a time crystal of various dimensions
(Figure 10.5). Therefore, the paper of Turing analogy is the
perception that is projected to the other human we interact,
but two factors are always common, data is 11D or dodecanion tensor but always presented as a quaternion form for linguistic reasons.

How to picturize a PPM in the real universe: (a) Argument

and on forever (information expression). Replace one argument as architecture of confusion in the form of a fractal

or energy expression). Just one clock in the form of a fractal
network. (c) Oscillator inside an oscillator inside an oscillator... this goes on and on and on forever (hardware expression)...Just one oscillator in the form of a fractal network.
(d) A waveform inside a waveform inside a waveform inside
a waveform. It goes on and on and on forever (continuation
expression). Just one waveform in the form of a fractal network. (e) A rhythm inside a rhythm inside a rhythm inside a
rhythm... this goes on and on and on (decisional or computational expression). Just one rhythm in the form of a fractal

network. (f) Turing tape inside the cell of a Turing tape inside
the cell of a Turing tape inside the cell of a Turing tape inside
the cell of a Turing tape... this goes on and on and on (machine
expression)—just one tape in the form of a fractal network.
So, I have often made a hypothesis that ultimately physics
will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end
the machinery will be revealed, and the laws will turn out
to be simple, like the checker board with all its apparent
complexities.
Richard Feynman, The character
of physical law, 1974

Derivation of physics laws from no laws: Wheeler advocated to derive physics laws from no laws (Wheeler, 1980,
1983a, 1985), his PhD student Feynman was no different as
we have seen in the above quote. As the computational capability of massively parallel supercomputing architectures is
increasing linearly for the last half a century, thanks to the
boons of Gordon Moor’s law, researchers at the singularity
university have got a fantastic game of “predicting the future
of mankind.” Any parameter they plot defining a particular
feature of the human civilization starting from economics to
medicine turns out to be linear. The total number of toothbrushes used by human race per decade to the development
of every single technology we can imagine, falls into the category of linear development. One should strongly object the
argument that these are nothing but an artifact created by a
clever choice of representing parameters. Even if we consider
that some tricks have been used to modify the representation
of parameters, so that it looks linear, we cannot ignore the
fact that existing civilization is monotonous and humans are
not playing with its technological fundamentals. If they could,
it would not have been possible to convert any parameter to
such a linear form. While we do not rule out the argument
that it is possible in principle to draw a straight line even on
the surface of a stormy ocean, it is however impossible to generate products through a linear development by adopting the
technology of “simultaneity.” When we ignore symmetry in
a stochastic fluctuation, everything could be linear, but the
inception of “simultaneity” would induce non-linearity even
at the plank scale which cannot be manipulated. We manipulate complex patterns from the stock market to astrophysics in such a manner as if at a time only two bodies exist
and then try to ignore the very parallelism at the local scale
in the quest for finding a global relationship. Unknowingly
we, the human race, oversimplify everything that happens
around us using only one principle, “complete destruction of
parallelism.” It is the reason, linearity is everywhere, yes, we
are arguing to change the practice of mathematical formulation by nested clock approach that potentially more suits to
address simultaneity.
We fail to recover this information because sequential
expressions create a strange world; one can make millions of
innovative and creative ways to create those alternate worlds
similar to reality. However, every time, failure is ensured by
the attempt to recovering the data following a linear process.
Recovery of the lost data should start with a pattern itself,

305

a seed argument that contains an arbitrary set of information queries, however all queries are coupled in a particular
way. The particular chain of coupling that links several other
arguments is not an expression, but again another set of patterns. The bottom line is that to survive in this universe with
original information, we must not speak, avoid any step that is
sequential, and preferably draw images capturing all associated information within its frame.
The dangerous philosophy of black box practices:
Currently the accuracy of computation is defined by the size
of clusters embedded in the supercomputer, i.e., the amount of
money invested. The research group which gets more money
would derive a solution with better “resolution.” The reason
is very simple. When we couple the small two particles boxes
“dangerously,” then to compensate we come up with successive courses of never-ending manipulations. When we attempt
to model nature, we simply try to find the global weight of
a parameter in an equation. The equation means we have a
left hand side equating to the right-hand side. We prefer to
keep a parameter lonely in the left-hand side, which will be
determined by experiment. In the right-hand side we keep
all fundamental variables that generate the left-hand side;
the right-hand parameters can couple between themselves
in various different ways, like a square of the first one, the
logarithm of the second, sinusoidal function of the third, etc.
The history of science is basically a documentation of arguments on proper placing or weightage given to the parameters
embedded in an equation. Arguments and counter-arguments
on the constants used in the equation were paramount in the
last century. A close correlation through the feed-forward network between experimentalists and the theorists has made the
expressions perfect in explaining the experimental output. An
experiment is a process, by which the effect of all system variables is nullified except the measuring one.

10.8 MACHINES OF THE FUTURE
10.8.1 The Difference between Circuits
of Wand Circuits of Time
A comparative study between time crystal computing and
artificial intelligence: Linearization of events is not accurate: Artificial intelligence has thus far considered that all
events could be expressed as a sum of a series of elementary
sub-events. Here in natural intelligence the events are not linearly connected. They are intricately connected by phase in
1D, 2D and 3D geometries. It means, if an event has several
parts, their intricate relationships are neither in series nor in
parallel. A temporal 3D wiring of sub-events exhibiting 11D
dynamics is a reality. When one tries to draw the connections,
3D phase wiring should remain intact; one cannot draw it on a
2D surface. Every corner of this geometric wiring of events is
important. A corner holds a unique geometric structure inside
that is also a 3D network of sub-events. A singular change
in this worldview changes everything in the Turing information theory. Consequently, the whole research field of artificial
intelligence is redefined into natural intelligence.

306

Nanobrain

Why does this little change affect so much? When all
events are considered as a 3D wiring of sub-events, then
immediately all events turn unpredictable, just like quantum
(Durr et al., 1992). Say, one is looking into a complicated 3D
network. It would appear differently in different directions.
Now, the second problem is even more serious. Every event
has a 3D network of sub-events inside. It means, there is an
infinite journey for any observer who wants to find out the
basic event that gives rise to all other events. It is a disruptive
idea. One could immediately notice that an “event” becomes
an undefined function. The third immediate effect is that an
observer has to limit its sensing time width between limits.
It is not like cutting a tape, it is cutting a 3D rock. If the lower
limit is cut, even after cutting the rock appears as the same.
Thus, an observer recreates an event. First, by finding a suitable orientation around the 3D event architecture. Second,
by locating itself wherein the infinite journey, it would fit.
Finally, to sense it, cutting off the event architecture based on
the observer’s own time limits. We have detailed these discussions in the Chapter 5.

et al., 2014) or activate new age chemical bots (Ghosh et al.,
2016b). (2) Increased human sense bandwidth: PPM
restricts the time-bandwidth of a brain like a computer. By
harnessing the PPM, mathematically, human ++ intelligence
could be developed. (3) Halt aging-related processes significantly: Editing age requires a true PPM hardware to feed cells
with real vibrational data. The hardware would correct the
clocking errors in the age-related proteins and complexes. (4)
Understanding of the language of natural events like the
beating of earth’s magnetic field and every life form: GML
is a universal language. It could be scaled up to replace the fitting with a black box, equations, to a group of patterns explaining fundamental physics theories (Feynman, 1965) (Sahu et al.,
2009, 2012). (5) Developing a truly dynamic model where
we cannot find any logic: e.g., earthquake, weather change,
the evolution of a virus, aging, side effects of drugs, dynamics of gaseous clouds, etc. Non-computing hardware learns
higher-level rules. Thenceforth, it bridges the missing links in
the information architecture and spontaneously simulates the
future instantly. It can morph events much better than the previous cellular automaton based architectures (Bandyopadhyay
et al., 2010b; Sahu et al., 2009, 2012). (6) Science of human

little gross information about any event. Then from that little
information, it generates dynamics at time scales that it has
never encountered in the past. (8) The noise would replace
signal, enter into the era of ultra-low power: Earlier, scaling
up was like adding more resources, faster speed, more power,
etc. Now, it is all about how one could make a device that captures a much longer slice of PPM. (9) Predict and simulate’
million-year evolution in’ a finite time (the science of evolution): Currently there is no tool to estimate evolution because
this is a slow process. Non-computer, by using GML and the
PPM, could project a far more reliable picture of the future. (10)
Machines of nature: The PPM, by intimately interacting with
nature, can design scientifically life-like machines, it could be
an architect.
Among various laboratories across the globe, several products of similar nature are being developed, we have categorized them into ten classes and outlined them in Figure 10.7.
In Figure 10.8 we have outlined some of the primitive instruments that were the foundation of building time crystal map of

the human brain (Chapter 7) and the brain jelly to implement
that model and build an artificial brain (Chapter 9). The first
instrument is a dual study of patch-clamp and coaxial probe,
Ghosh et al. saw live in 2008 that neuron firing is outcome
of signals in the microtubule strings deep below the neuron.
The second instrument is the detection of time crystal using
a simulator called time crystal analyzer. The third instrument
is quantum cloaking discovery, the path how in the random
mess of fourth-circuit elements, only the desired devices see
each other, others go silent. The fourth instrument is for seeing magnetic vortices using a modified quantum entanglement measurement set up. The fifth and final instrument was
regulating organic nano brain using an antenna.

what it seeks (no search). Search a massive database without searching (spontaneous reply). It never acquires a true
input; it has all possible input elements already inside as
part of the GML. So, it searches for them outside, thenceforth, a spontaneous reply is its operational key. (ii) Multiple
nested clocks one inside another enable “a virtual instant
decision-making,” It runs 24-7 as it evolves its wiring by
itself for learning driven by PPM, a computation never stops,
solutions are sent periodically, “halt” means observer’s prerogative to shut acquiring a solution. (iii) It does not have
any software program (no ­software). No programming is
required as “cycles self-assemble/dis-assembly for better
sync at all possible time scales simultaneously.” (iv) “Phase
space” keeps “volume intact” as required resources only
increase the phase density not real space. Computing power
is not related to energy consumption, there could even be a
negative consumption; It shrinks massive information into
a small geometric clock assembly or a seed of time ­crystal.
It follows a unique superposition of 10 classes of PPMs, each
sub-metric represents a set of unique geometric patterns to
link events. (v) Perpetual spontaneous editing of slower time
cycles (creation/destruction/defragmentation) “prepare for
unknown” = higher-level learning. It introduces “fractal resolution,” a complex signal’s lowest and fastest time scale signals are absorbed. simultaneously, and during expansion, the
fractal seed delivers full output, from a seed of information

(drastic shrinking of data). (vi) It runs by white noise, better
randomness in noise is preferred. It uses an ultra-low power;
only to manage re-wiring, non-computing does not require
power in principle, as there is no reduction, no collapse,
and no junction. (vii) The superposition of simultaneously
operating a million paths assembles into a sphere enables
“extreme parallelism.” In quantum, only one Bloch sphere,
here sphere inside a sphere inside a sphere… It explores
singularity and used fractal mechanics, nothing to do with
classical or quantum. (viii) Time cycle is the memory, rotation along the cycle is processing, are same events, “no
transport needed between memory and processing units,” no
wiring. No wiring, a completely wireless connection of vortex fields. A wireless connection to process geometry at all
the time scales is allowed in the hardware simultaneously.
(ix) No logic gate, no reduction of choices, which ensures
that “speed” is irrelevant. The computer is made of one element only, clocks; considers only parameter phase. It considers only parameter phase, emulate mass, space and time
to process information. It expands the input information
using PPM, hacks nature to predict a gross future. (x) All
sensory information is converted to one geometric language
that allows “perception,” a yellow color could have a taste.
Perception is not programming as wrongly perceived. It has
a unified homogeneous fractal hardware for everything,
learning changes them.

Uploading Consciousness—The Evolution of Conscious Machines of the Future

10.9 PLAYING WITH CHEAP, HANDY TOOLS
TO BREAK THE PARADIGM OF THOUGHT
Will the unknown remain unknown? Exploring a Science
Fiction in the making: Artificial brain won’t be a real computer, but we are making a user. The computer runs by itself.
But then, who is the original driver? The metric of primes created by Reddy S. et al. exclusively for the computer, runs the
show inside its core hardware. What is the metric? And why a
metric would have the power to do remarkable things? When
we work on building a metric, like good old days of astrophysics, PPM-GML-H protocols also becoming as religious entity
as a Turing machine. In astrophysics, theoreticians used to
have a space-time metric, while doing complex math, students
used to refer to the metric time to time and retrieve all essential data to solve planetary problems. Similarly, for natural
intelligence (AI) we explored here a new metric of primes,
namely space-time-topology-time. The idea is to hack nature
and make a computer that can generate most patterns that we
see in nature, so that unknown is known via PPM. How to
perfectly build an effective prime metric architecture, or how
to advance our primitive conscious bot (Chapter 9) is to be
a matter of investigation for a longer time, but it cannot be
ruled out that the concept to use a prime metric as a prime
decision-maker is a new concept altogether. Self-awareness
would require post-mortem of PPM-GML-H prescribed here.
The existing information theory is based on the idea of
the known. FIT, (Fractal Information Theory, Chapter 2),
wherein tools are there to bridge two known domains through
an unknown path. It is an important change from the era of
information theory that was existing for the last century. What
is the trick that I know the unknown? We can do it if we build
a universal metric that keeps all possible solutions, just like
the space-time metric that is being used for nearly a century
with little modifications to discover a new and new physical
phenomenon that was never known. If we are not surprised
how a space-time metric discovered in the 1920s is able to
provide us new and new discoveries over a century, we should
not be surprised that a similar metric for natural intelligence a
11D space-time-topology-prime metric would trigger another
revolution. Of course, this is not a known culture in AI, but we
feel that people would get accustomed to this culture of building architecture of confusion in day-to-day life.
Imagine we have two parts of music, and we have a kit that
would combine two parts of the music with a new one in the
middle, and that new music would make a sense to our mind.
Similar things would be true in handling large data, it would
generate unseen patterns in the big data. The reason we would
like to inspire readers to build a DIY kit so that every people
in the world could get free access to the information revolution knowing nature as it is. Why not seeing the share market
using time crystal, build chatbots for the olds and deserted,
build machines to give birth to new machines!!!
The beauty of PPM based computing is that we get the
total picture at once. Then, more the time pass by, more the
information arrives, from 50% reliability to 66% reliability to

309

72% reliability to 76% reliability to… the journey moves on
toward 99% reliability, beyond which not possible to achieve.
What brain jelly does is absorbing the dynamics related to new
primes. Absolute reliability is a trademark of the existing computers, but for PPM-GML-H triad, “zooming the unknown” as
a function of time and more detailed input is the key. The artificial brain would be a toy to change the perspective of this
world, not step-by-step, rather, within and above. Not just playing a game, if we are in an unknown territory about which we
have absolutely no information, then, the product computer or
user can provide a good overview, instantly with 66% success
rate. Uncharted territories are increasing every day with the data
explosion. If we humans do not have a technology to estimate
what is there in the uncharted territory, we cannot do anything.
Accidents would create massive havoc on human society.
1. Imagine a virus is silently evolving into a dangerous
species. Some prime metric hardware is there to perpetually track the development of the virus evolution
and perfecting the prediction to monitor its evolution. Thus, it could estimate the terror threat well in
advance.
2. From the Microwave background data of the universe, it could estimate the structure of the universe
partially.
3. From the massive data flow of the internet, it could
find patterns of threats, like cyber attack.
4. It can monitor and predict all possible climate
change, where the future predictions are not possible
due to complexity.
5. It can monitor individual health over the years and
learn about individual health crisis well in advance.
Typical health problems exclusive to a person could
be identified and cared.
6. Economics will become a scientific subject of study
as the computer would build predictable models perfecting it over time.
7. Social science and psychology will become a scientific subject as verifiable predictable models would
be there, that could be rejected or accepted by logic.
8. General science would get a tool to study the absolute
property of a system, not a fitting model, thus, even
scientific studies would get a better cross checker of
its conclusions.
9. Evolution of life could be tracked scientifically,
not just in the past, but also the future to be predicted.
10. Lifelike machines of the future will come, which
would have their own operation lifetime and after a
certain time, they will die just like living systems.

10.10 NUMEROLOGY OF HUMAN

of the human brain in Figure 10.9. From biology to physics
to mathematics, the emergence of a few numbers, especially
primes in the human brain, have been astonishing. They may
be accidental or mere coincidence, it does not matter, a good
summary would refresh readers mind about how the brain
adventure unfolded.
The pattern of primes in the life and culture: Twentythree tonal patterns used in 10,552 versus of Rig Veda: During
information processing, a large number of fractal seeds of
time crystals are generated and during memory retrieval, they
expand and create the entire image. It is incredible memory
management, within a few numbers of oscillators we can
encode entire complex architecture. Indian classical music has
a concept called raga, each raga is a packet of seven frequency
notes; a singer needs to sing low to high and then high to low
frequency to complete a period. For thousands of years, these
songs are perfected to generate a particular feeling in the mind
of the listener the frequencies are changed by tiny values,
feedback cycles run generations after generations (Ganeri,
2001). Often the singer expands the seed geometric pattern
for hours in various styles to create maximum impact on the
mind of the listener. The rigorous mathematics for the composition of such classical songs suggest a very similar behavior. With 47 notable sound frequencies (48 letters including

Om sound), each representing a meaning, the Sanskrit language was made, that uses the matrix-vector projection mathematical formulation to convert a word to include space,
time, context, sexuality, the transformed word is used to create 23 different classes of rhythms in Vedas, based on tonal
ratios (1:2, 1:3, 2:3, 3:5, etc), just like we did in Chapter 7 for
pattern recognition, tones recur cyclically at every doubling
or halving the frequency (rhythm used to generate time fractals by Vedic tradition). Logic in Vedas is geometric (Yantra,
Mandala), uses 3p5q formulation (p, q are ±, hence they made
triangle upside down to construct Sri-Yantra) to create all
tones (male), 2r is used as added dimension (female), together
they make the universe (Nicolus and McClain), we found pattern of prime similarly and ordered factors provide universal
fractal chain in Chapter 2. Vedas used all arithmetic, geometric and harmonic infinite series using 2, 3, and 5, while notes
make a packet of 7, still Indian musicians use rhythm packets
of 17 tunes (in a loop of 18 bits), including all prime numbers up to 47 (prime = 6n ± 1). Fractional infinite time series
(time fractal f(t)), were also used (e.g., 5–7 and 3–6 time series
define Kalpa Bramha, 5–10 time series defines Universe as
an egg i.e., Hiranyagarbha etc.). Nested rhythm as time crystal presented in this book was extensively used in 5000 years
of Sanskrit texts, fastest clocks were even number of hymns,

Uploading Consciousness—The Evolution of Conscious Machines of the Future

chapters, words, letters were specifically chosen to make it
rhythm inside a rhythm, entire book has to be a song, like the
complete time crystal model presented for the human brain
(Figures 7.14 and 7.15).

10.11 FREQUENCY WHEELS OF
AN EVOLVING BRAIN
The PPM world starts from fractal tape, ends in the collective
evolution of machines: A summary: Turing’s world of computing considers every single element is complete in itself, just like
that a “matter” is complete; nothing inside/outside is changing it.
Completeness enables discrete and binary true/false argument to
define it. We get a Turing world. The PPM vision has one argument, one energy packet, one Turing like tape, one clock, one
rhythm, one oscillator that encompasses the entire universe, but
if we enter inside any of them, we find millions of that inside,
the journey continues forever, whether we zoom in/out. Unlike
Turing, any “matter” is conceptually incomplete so we need
matter+energy+topology+symmetry tetrality to connect all matters inside and outside. The wheels of life presented in Figures 10.10
and 10.11 are combinations of both matter and energy.
Conserved energy takes the form of periodic oscillation
or rhythm and maintains time, but each rhythm has rhythms
inside/outside (Figure 10.10). We cannot isolate any small
piece of argument from tape network, hence, no bits or arguments like true/false, that leads to no classical information
content. Observer/user is also part of the tape network. Entire

311

rhythm net, or time crystal that encompasses everything is
represented as a matrix of truth with infinite dimensions, no
rhythm is ever destroyed, no choice is ever rejected. Unlike
Turing, fractal tape (PPM tape) needs four new steps, resonate
(with a rhythm), expand (self-assembly of rhythms), phase
transition (of rhythms), and spontaneous reply (the rhythms).
Self-similarity of shape/rhythm appears/disappears with time,
as rhythms couple/decouple with other rhythms, changes the
structural symmetry of matters to memorize a particular set
of frequencies for a rhythm. The entire tape network is neverending resonance chain of coupled matters that vibrate with
rhythm, means, local rhythms vibrate as a distinct entity in
parts of the tape.
Since observer/user is also part of the rhythms of the
tape-network, it senses by perpetual local synchrony and
de-synchrony with various parts of the tape, thus, its “sensing” not computation by the classical theory of computation.
At the bottom part of Figure 10.9, when we summarized
the numbers important for the adventure of the brain, we
showed how vibrations that were mere a spectrum thus
far have become time crystals. That journey continued in
Figures 10.10 and 10.11 where we have increased layers of
ET tape or clock inside a clock… and then made efforts to
increase complexity one by one. The equivalent life forms
that the time crystal model could represent is shown side by
side. The idea is to suggest possibly the billions of years of
evolutions from a single molecule to the complex life form
have been a journey of time crystals. We see a catalog of

life forms created by nature in the planet, maybe it simply
added more and more clocks following the PPM described
in Chapter 3.

10.12 SYNTHESIS OF CRITICAL
BRAIN FEATURES EVEN BEFORE
WE MEET THE ALIENS
We have created a table in Figure 10.12, where we have shown
that if mathematics is the fundamental basis for human consciousness then, it would not be the last or only one kind of
consciousness. There would be various kinds of consciousness.
The human brain explored in the book could be represented
by one integer, 12. Why? 2 × 2 × 3 could be written in three
ways, so a higher level geometry one could create. It means the
human brain using 12 components, each of which could process
higher-level decision-making (each component have 12 bands
to operate), realize consciousness. However, the same could be
achieved by 2 × 2 × 5, possibilities are infinite. The table suggests how to build higher than human consciousness machines.
Of course they would never be machines anymore. The most
interesting is the case for 37 primes or case of 36, then higherlevel geometry that makes human conscious as per the definition of current discussion would make a truly higher conscious
alien whom, humans could not even understand.
Projects similar to PPM computing: There are plenty
of brain-building projects, some of the projects do consider
nested networks and interference as a tool to reach the goal

(Ersatz brain project, J. A. Anderson), not only that the fractal
analysis of neurodynamics does provide greater understanding of the mind-brain paradox (King, 1996). Quantum chaos
has been used as a tool to explain synchronization, in this
book, classical synchronization formulations are provided,
however, given that in the molecular scale quantum mechanical principles are significantly active, the role of quantum
chaos in delivering multi-scale synchronization cannot be
ruled out. Especially, since algebraic-geometric tools are
extensively used in representing the entanglement and superposition (Bernardi and Carusotto, 2011), a complete analog to
this book in terms of pure quantum mechanics is possible to
formulate.
Artificial brain is the last machine of mankind: First
machine to learn what is nature: We must bypass the era
of brain-less bots: The era of conscious machines: Artificial
brain would be the last machine of mankind, since willingly
or unwillingly the human race wants to reach that point when
the machines would take over. If algorithm-based instruction
is the key, robots would learn it, outperform humans in every
aspect, we have to make a new world of technology where
the algorithm does not exist. The era of life-like machines
or conscious machines is human destiny now. We live in an
exponential information age; everything around us is changing so rapidly that after a few years, a third-year engineering
student would have to discard everything he studied in the
previous two years, simply because of the fast-technological
implementations of an invented technology in the industry.

FIGURE 10.12 A table shows how artificial brain’s decision-making power could be enhanced beyond humans to the aliens who are
not known to mankind. Below, the garden of gardens GOG representation of higher than human’s information processing capabilities are
shown as ones GOG is others petal of flower.

Now, the problem is that we cannot ignore the elementary
interactions as we normally do in the formulations of physics theory, simply because one fundamental element could be
me. Therefore, when we try to create an alternative model,
we should consider that many-body networks generated at the
single element level. We are not far away from a time, when
we will not ask the pressure exerted by 1 gm-mole gas, rather
we would seek for the information contained in a single gas
molecule in that container. It is beyond our brain capacity to
process, but we are all pushing human civilization to a point
where there will be no turning back, everything around us
would estimate and beyond a certain limit that we humans
could access using our intelligence, but could feel with our
senses.
One option would be to wait, until nature adopts another
structural evolution of the entire brain architecture, or holding a micro-brain device on our palm. It will be like we will
carry several brains similar to the power of our brain and
our brain will work as a manager to these brains, a superior
authority which plays only with the output of the inferior
brains (Figure 10.12). Nano brain will not be a superior intelligence provider, rather, the last tool of ours to survive in a
world where intelligence will be clustered into various pockets whose domains will be decided by something which is
not a human, not a machine, not a software, but a virtual life
form that is composed of everything we see around us. We
will give birth to this unknown creature, who will not have
any life form, yet would govern the evolution of every living
and non-living things in that world.

While the ever-expanding brain is colliding continuously
with the restricted space inside our skull, we are amazed by
the synchronous burst of neurons between the two ends of our
brains separated by 15 cm. We take shelter into this remarkable phenomenon of simultaneous bursts of neurons because
we belong to the class of living species that do not like to
walk along with a one-dimensional tape to process information since looking here and it is not allowed there. The question that always troubles us that if we have that creature, will
it destroy the mankind, in reply we would argue that we try to
preserve baboons and chimps not kill them, so the new creatures will not kill humans, they will feel pity for us. Also do
not forget that supremacy does not come alone, severe weaknesses will be there in their hardware too and supreme conscious beings born among the human race have always talked
about love not hate. When we try to build artificial brains, we
are not attempting to create Frankenstein, we have enough of
them among humans already.
The first machine to understand nature as-is: Why we
exist? The triangular relationship between the GML, a PPM
and a fourth-circuit element (Hinductor, H) change the worldview forever. The century-old faiths that “no question, no
answer,” is found to be a wrong question, a reply may come
even if no question is asked, fate could be decided even without
communication and without measurement. Hardware engineered by the PPM has a guideline for an infinite chain reaction, a drive to match the intricate details of patterns between
the two participators that cannot reach an equilibrium ever.
The language of bit and the language of the continuum can

coexist as part of GML, wherein the quantum is a local perspective of the global engineering of singularity governed by
PPM. Light has a gradient but the darkness is pure; sound
has colors, but the silence is pure; a defined state is finite,
but a singularity is infinite; a non-prime is rich in factors and
decisions, but fixed; in contrast, a prime is neural, pure and a
creator of an endless pattern like a life form. The language of
Bekenstein number includes a human bias, where the number of bits was everything, the primes exhibiting the knots
of darkness is pure, because it sees nothing but symmetry,
thus, a few, say 12–14 primes only use 12–14 ways of ordering
the geometric shapes to link 99.99% events, structures, that
has happened, that are happening and what would happen in
the future. We exist because of primes. Thus, we grasp the
central idea of it all as so simple, so beautiful, so compelling
that we could say to each other, “Oh, how -could it have been
otherwise! How could we all have been so blind so long!.” Let
humanity begin its journey to learn nature as is by harnessing
its last machine.

10.13 A CYCLE OF A GARDEN
FROM FLOWER TO A PETAL
Without mentioning the case of meander flower garden we
could not finish the discussion on the higher than human consciousness. Humans follow the garden of garden of meander
flowers as described in Chapters 2, 6, and 7. When universe
would create a catalog of conscious machines then it would
take a set of petals from multiple garden of gardens and build
another garden of meander flowers. Therefore, the table is
shown in Figure 10.12 where using simply the mathematical argument we extrapolated the human consciousness to an
infinite journey, the same journey could be viewed in terms of
meander flower gardens.

Nanobrain

When every part of a system grows simultaneously, spontaneously: Imagine we have an architecture of self-assembled
time crystals and every part of it is growing, or imagine our
whole body, every part of it is growing simultaneously, spontaneously. Conventional science teaches us that there should
be a boundary point and beyond that everything would remain
static, and then only we would analyze the dynamics happening inside. Here, we have a universal guideline, we create a
guideline for how symmetries could change spontaneously.
We know how symmetries would break and adopt a new symmetry point. Learning to live with everything that is changing
continuously is the new kind of science and we are looking
into one such new kinds of practices, engineering of singularity, adventuring confusion, being random and logically circular, doing nonsense. It is a totally new experience, a journey
where time and space evolutions would appear messy, random, unpredictable because everything talking to everything
has global symmetries, we may look into that. In this world of
science, even topology would not take us far, we need a new
kind of drawing, the mathematics of patterns. Equations won’t
help, the interactions of the imaginary worlds would be the
mother of all algebras. In this new type of mathematics, we
only draw things and the rest of the solutions are automatically
derived, we envision a kid of 21st century drawing only circles
to solve problems which super-supercomputers cannot fathom.
By drawing circles and circles alone, infinity is explored, it is a
world of undefined and feedback from infinity. That infinity is
the universe itself, it is the complete time crystal, somewhere
in a singularity point our times crystals are vibrating and discussing about conscious machines.
The total number of minds in the universe is one. In fact,
consciousness is a singularity phasing within all beings.

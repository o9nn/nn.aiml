A Complete, Integrated Time
Crystal Model of a Human Brain

7.1 BRAIN IS THE ENGINEERING OF
PRIME NUMBERS EMBEDDED IN
A TRIPLET OF TRIPLET CAGE
Looking beyond current neuroscience: Mapping the entire
human brain in terms of biological rhythms: The brain
is a noise harvesting machine, a linguistic device, wherein
the information unit is a triplet of time crystals run subjectclause-verb/adjective of a sentence (Green et al., 2017). Since
the brain converts all kinds of signals in terms of pulses,
eventually, letters of brain-language are determined by the
variability in pulse shaping and the grammar of this language would have two distinct sections. Information is geometric in the brain (Nie et al., 2014), collective oscillations of
hills and crests of information builds human thoughts (Tank
and Hopfield, 1987), then, dynamics of time is neuroscience
(Rabinovich et al., 2008). First, the basic rules for pulse shaping that makes sure that the pulses are distinctly identified
based on their sensory-origins. Second, rules for the superposition of distinctly different streams of pulses. Third, coupling
and de-coupling rules among different wave-streams coming
from different sensory-organs. However, current neuroscience
believes that the brain is all about neurons, no cognitive processing inside a neuron, the membrane does everything, and
wiring at the neuron level contains all necessary information
for the brain’s information processing. The neuron-level wiring is the key for all brain mapping projects, but they ignore,
neurons use clocks to talk (Gerisch et al., 1975). Since no two
human brains have similar circuits and connections evolve at
every moment, we need a new language to read the “circuits
in action” for cognition that does not depend on the specifics
of the wiring. One such parameter is, to the PPM-GML-H
(phase prime metric-geometric musical language-hinductor)
triad, the brain has various distinct operating circuit layers
both below and above the neuron levels. All circuits in a

layer (say protein circuits or cortical column circuits) operate
at various frequency domains, thus instead of one at neuron
layer, we want to create multiple brain maps at various time
domains. All these maps would co-exist and interact simultaneously. Geometric language for brain mapping is rhythms or
cycles of vibrations as time crystals generated by the chain of
vibrations that connects circuits of all layers. Creation of such
a map would enable one to generate quantifiable behaviors
using hierarchical temporal maps of the brain (Salthe, 1985).
As the external environment changes, the ripple effect
enters inside the brain through a particular frequency domain
of the rhythm map of the brain, even a pulse of light could
reset a mind (Rusak, 1993; Strogatz, 1990); environment
shapes mind (Barrett, 2011). When we listen to others, speech
builds an architecture of time (Shannon et al., 1995), inside
the brain speech resembles music (Schwartz et al., 2003;
Brown et al., 2006). Plasticity of a brain is active even in space
(Koppelmans, 2016). On the other hand resonances in the ionhemisphere affect the rhythms of a human brain (Rusov et al.,
2012), the temporal disorder is the key for many mental disorders (Rensing et al., 1987). The internal low frequency or
large time period rhythms start changing, the brain and the
entire body undergo minimum atomically precise motion at
various layers to adjust to the modified rhythms and that we
define as decision-making of the brain. A resonance chain of
the entire body that links all brain components as a triplet of
triplet clocks (Berliner and Neurath, 1965) harmonizes with
that of the external environment’s perturbation to the internal
rhythms. While major brain researchers connect functional
domains of brain circuits, there are few yet very important
research on event-based coherent communication of brain
parts (Andrew and Pfurtscheller, 1996).
Not anyone but all components collectively process
information: Neuron holds center stage of neuroscience
to artificial intelligence (Reynolds and Desimone, 1999).

The human brain-body structure has so many layers of materials one inside another, circadian rhythms propagate at all
layers (Aschoff, 1965a; Aschoff and Wever, 1976). Why
not ever anyone thought that the information is not processed
at any particular layer, or in between a group of layers, but all
the layers build an architecture of time where information is
processed. Differentiability or if we measure the variation of
two states of a cell between two time intervals or the variation
of states between two neighboring cells cannot be defined.
Because there are many cells inside and each cell is part of
many cells outside. States of each cell are incomplete. As
said, a fractal can never be touched. In this case what will
be the machine that would work? Since nothing is touching
each other but everything is a door to a world within, the
only way to communicate is a “resonance chain.” Chain
of vibration, i.e., time or clocks, the idea advances an old
proposal, “brain encodes information using time” (Buzsáki
et al., 1994b; Buzsáki, 2006; Buonomano, 2017). Earlier
brain science had only ionic rhythm (Bub et al., 1998),
now above and below neuron-level we include all forms of
polarization, weak van der Waals to atomic in 12 imaginary

nested layers. Electromagnetic brain theory came long back
(Jirsa and Haken, 1996). The objective would be engineering a brain that would have 12–15 components for processing exclusive time crystals for 15 primes (Figures 3.4 and
7.1a, b).
What is the elementary decision-making machine
of the brain, say, an alternative of Turing, or a switch?
Human brain might not be a discrete sum of machines as
we are naturally taught to believe in the Turing world. Since
neuromagnetic rhythms flow in the brain with a time period
of minutes in space independent manner (Ramkumar et al.,
2012), each brain component would vibrate with a selective
set of primes as described in Figure 3.4. Resonance chain =
specialized PPM of Figure 3.4. We should look at the physical structure of the brain as described in Figure 7.1c, d,
find which primes are governing its structural symmetry,
make exclusive metric for that component. That metric is
the processor of the brain’s information as a time crystal.
Now, what can this small chain do? (1) Resonate with the big
chain to exchange time crystals with each other. (2) Rhythms
would expand inside each of them, in doing so they will

weaker because of the external input of rhythms, like phase
transition. (4) Spontaneous reply back of the rhythm or time

and mechanically. (5) Harvest noise, filter it into a signal

factor (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009). So, it will be a new AI,
because in the domain of current AI, only neurons work, but
here, the entire body is the brain, and we go inside continuously to the molecular scale to complete the resonance chain
to define the machine. Also, the machine does not end inside
our body it takes metrics of our immediate environment.
Design principles of synchronization oscillators by nature
in the cellular systems show that it uses a basic geometric
language that we use for pattern recognition, the small oscillators are arranged in the elementary geometric shape to generate all possible oscillators. Figure 7.1d shows primes for
human-brain body system (C2 symmetry), connectome (C5
symmetry), fornix and cingulate gyrus (C3 and C7 symmetry), blood vessel and spinal structure (C5 symmetry), C47
symmetry in 47 functional cortex regions (Garey, 2006), etc.
The symmetry of prime number of components based time
crystal model of brain leaves no component, the entire brainbody system is part of the new time crystal model of the
human brain model proposed here (Chiel and Beer, 1997).
The time gap between interhemispheric transfer tells how
information specializes left and right brain (Ringo et al.,
1994), thus C2 symmetry activates.
Why do we want time crystal map of the entire human
brain? The temporal architecture of the human brain interests many (Llinás, 1994). (1) No two human brains have
similar connectivity, and connections in the brain change
continuously throughout the life of a person. The mechanics
of an observer is unknown, and that is the first step to learn
about the brain (Bennett et al., 1989). (2) Natural vibrations
or resonant properties are fundamental to any material property, periodic vibrations are rhythms, a complete brain map of
rhythms from atoms to the largest scale could unravel a map
that would have some features not specific to the hardware of
a particular human at a particular time. Rhythm across species must be similar; otherwise they cannot interact, bursting
neurons are self-similar (Pinsker, 1977). (3) Be it classical or
quantum mechanical, or any physical or chemical event at any
scale, everything could be explained in terms of symmetry
breaking, so we replace the entire system in terms of “symmetry breaking.” Brain size variation across species show that
the brain rewires differently with size to keep the symmetry intact (Ringo, 1991). (4) Hierarchy of rhythms, at certain
level incorporates nature in its cycle, even to send a picture,
neurons create architecture of time and transmit (Richmond
et al., 1989). That’s why a body learns and adjust with nature
without conscious efforts. Thus, we will get to learn why there
is life? Now organisms are used as computers, in future, the
computer will be organisms, they would live, learn, give birth
to a new computer and die. (5) Just like we argue that the brain
is a non-computer, universal time crystal argues that there is
no communication (Pierce, 1961). When the whole body is

179

part of a one-time crystal composite, there is no need to run
separate signal transmission. A conformal replica could be
created in the receiver if both sender and receiver are built
using a brain that follows the same mathematical rules to link
discrete events of the past and extrapolate it to the future. (6).
More is different (Anderson, 1972). There are many parts of
the brain that are self-similar, fractal-like, following a fixed
symmetry, they do nothing. However, sometimes they change
the order, symmetry breaks. Anderson beautifully observed
in the classic paper that when systems become large, it does
not matter how many symmetries the constituents have, giant
systems also follow only a few symmetries. Reddy et al.
(2018) discovered the metric of primes in the brain, and the
metric of prime that we will propose here is conditioned to
start counting from 1, as soon as a system completes accounting for first 15 primes (up to 47). (7) Statistics is secondary,
the topology of symmetry is primary, so, how many neurons
do not matter, how many filamentary nanowires, or cortical
columns do not matter (Yates, 1987). The symmetries have
a language to talk to each other, and that is the most fundamental knowledge of nature. If we do not know that we cannot learn nature, or our existence. Our objective is to discover
that language. (8) The universe is massive, complex, so is the
world of elementary particles. The brain is a gift of nature,
that is low cost, easy to study compared to building a particle collider or gravitational wave observatory. One phase
reset curve builds one-time crystal, a composition of phase
reset curves means a composition of time crystals, which is
reported for the brain (MacKay, 1991). Stochastic evolution
of phase in neurons shows that time crystals may build a new
time crystal (Tuma et al., 2016), for delivering a greater control on excitatory and inhibitory properties (van Vreeswijk
and Sompolinsky, 1996). It would be exciting to see a brain
map extrapolated to the universe. (9). What is the learning
limit of a human brain? We want a solution of Chaitin’s query
(Delahaye, 1989). Singularities in an operating clock are the
keys for a time crystal architecture (Malinowski et al., 1985).
Phase diagram of a group of oscillators show that there is a
collective, unified phase behavior, human brain might integrate many clocks (Matthews and Strogatz, 1990). While integrating clocks, depending on the nature of dynamics, groups
of clocks with distinct dynamics are phase clocked with
each other (Wang, 1994). Rhythms of motor response argue
for a 3D geometry of clocks (Marder and Calabrese, 1996).
(10) The pattern of several phenomena is filled in physics
textbooks—is the brain designed in the same way nature
designs a physical phenomenon? (Small and Garfield, 1985;
Agu, 1988; Steen, 1988). The transition from rate code to
temporal code is studied for decades (Mehta et al., 2002),
this transition is universally captured in the generic time
crystal model of the human brain. The delicate relationship
between rate code and sub-threshold signals could open up a
new world of brain’s information processing (Radman et al.,
2007). Time crystal model considers the universe of subthreshold signals, which decides complex signal transformation in the neuron (Ratte et al., 2015), yet brain models do
not take them seriously.

(Figure 2.7c–e). Even if there are a large number of objects in
an image, the brain has to identify the abstract geometrical
relationships among different objects and creates an equivalent fractal for that abstract relationship also. In case of several different kinds of sensory input data, due to the natural
property of frequency fractal of the hardware, the patterns in
different parts of the artificial brain hardware (the entire brain
is a single fractal object) get correlated, and a new fractal of
seed geometry is formed. The brain circuit undergoes subtle
changes to incorporate these features. In this way, visual,
sound, taste, touch, and smell data get correlated in the hardware. It should be noted that for the highest-level operation of
the brain fractal hardware, the basic seed pattern of the new
input fractal is the highest-level perception data, this is saved
in a very particular region, these 47 cortex regions known
as Brodmann’s regions. The new fractals made of geometric
shapes are stored in the brain only when it does not match the
existing patterns; if it matches, there is no question for the
hardware to store anything new. Adding a flower in the garden
is a thought, adding a garden is learning of the intricate skill.

7.1.1 Four, Eight, and Twelve Imaginary
Worlds Work Together
Scale-free activities in the brain: Evolution of the brain
argues for a scale-free parameter for the animal kingdom
(Martin and Harvey, 1985). Signals propagating in the brain
are not just connected by frequency; there are ten parameters,
the transition from Fast Fourier Transform to time crystal analyzer means acquiring information from nature never acquired
before (Figure 2.8e). Phase locking in the propagating signals has been measured in the brain (Lachaux et al., 1999).
Multi-input, multi-output, non-linear dynamic modeling of
the brain argues for an extensive hierarchical information
processing (Berger et al., 2010). However, instead of massive
architectures, only the free energy principles have been used
to explain learning and creativity/intelligence (Friston et al.,
2011, 2006), and this is possible because of scale-free brain
functional networks (Eguiluz et al., 2005). Therefore, multilayer phase network, which is the foundation of several brain
models is not an imagination, it’s an extrapolation of a concrete
experimental observation. As per the energy expense, skeletal
muscle is the first, the liver is the second, and the brain is the
third; as per the information expense, a sensor is the first, midbrain is the second, and cortex is the third (Figure 7.1e). It is
already well established that the neural network in the brain
evolves its circuitry toward a metabolically efficient architecture. The dynamic synchronization of electrical activity fluctuates in a scale-free manner all over the brain (Gong, et al.,
2003), even in the ECG (Hwa and Ferree, 2002). The neurons
form clusters of a time crystal (Figures 6.13 and 6.14), larger

is the cluster, lower is the frequency of resonance. Since larger
cluster requires more power to operate, the power-frequency
relationship in the brain would follow an inverse relationship.
It has been shown that human brain operates via nested frequencies; it is not a band with continuously allowed frequency
values (He et al., 2010). The symmetry of structure helps in
modulating time. The brain has two hemispheres exhibiting a
C2 symmetry and prime 2. Here the timing difference between
the two hemispheres have been linked to a special selection of
functions (Ringo et al., 1994).
People survive without a complete brain; brain shows

2006)? When an MRI scan shows a giant hole in the brain
with a thin layer of cortex surviving, we wonder if this man
is conscious of what brain builders are doing by mapping the
neurons of a whole brain. The madness in replicating the cortex region for artificial brain needs a revisit, why 20 ­billion
cortex neurons out of total 85 billion neurons do not matter to his consciousness (Wheeler, 1981). Performing basic
information processing is possible even without a cerebellum.
Recently a Chinese lady was found without a cerebellum, and
except temporary nausea she did not feel any problem until
age 23. If half of the brain is cut off, the other half takes over,
even the medical cases are there without a brain at all, more
than age 2 or 3, the babies fail to survive. If enough time is
given, the brain cleans up and rebuilds an equivalent of the
system largely. The drive to locate consciousness at a particular place, object or process is weak, the lookout for a magic
switch to consciousness is primitive. Neuron size, number,
and density, nothing single-handedly determine the degree
of intelligence. The brain is largely a self-similar structure
of cavities nested one inside another, cross-talk between
clocks is common (Asher and Schibler, 2011). The cavity is
a robust concept, it is a function of wave functions frequency
or wavelength, and the nature of the wave determines what
kind of material we need to build the pot. A hollow metal ball
is not a cavity for a sound wave—for the sound, the object
does not exist almost—but it is a cavity for electromagnetic
wave. Neurons believed to float in the ocean of ions, what
if they float in the ocean of electric fields like an electric eel
(Rommell and McCleave, 1972). Whereas for a hollow glass
ball, it is a cavity for a sound wave, and for electromagnetic
wave it does not exist. The brain is not just a cavity network.
The cavity ensures a closed universe for the surfaces to operate. The brain is a nested architecture of time for topological
materials too, the surface geometry of objects is designed following the symmetry of prime numbers in such a way that it
can produce time crystals in the various frequency ranges and
dimensions. The brain has three layers, sensors produce quaternion tensors, the pathways and midbrain produce quaternions and the cortex produces dodecanions as 12D manifolds,
i.e., thoughts (Figure 7.1f). Since every human has a different
neural network, the map, how all neurons look in a brain is a

182

quest driven by madness, similar madness would be if we go
for mapping the cavity, or surface architecture from bottom to
the top. What that is invariant in the brain is the symmetry of
the primes. Thus, PPM and time crystal made of GML would
be the key to find a brain model that would enable researchers
across the globe to study it comprehensively in a lab-protocol
independent manner.
Sensors are part of the artificial brain, a network of
the skin is similar to cortex; clocking genes are everywhere: Until now biological clocks were limited to a group
of neurons. When we experimentally establish that those
clocks do not end at the neuron skin but are connected further down below to a protein scale (Sahu, 2013a, 2013b,
2014; Ghosh et al., 2016a), our body becomes an integrated
chain of clocks, from the atomic scale to the ultimate
boundary. Even very recently, the body’s master clock was

in the brain made of 20,000 neurons. The 6,000 astroglia

just shown that astrocytes clock those neurons, both clocks
cross-talk (Tso, 2017), Almost all body cells, e.g., lung,
heart, liver, and sperm keep time, with a few exceptions
such as stem cells.
All pulses are similar in the brain; the necessity for
inventing a new kind of time crystal sensor: Currently
neural code alone build’s brain code (Kuffler and Nichols,
1977; Konishi, 1990). Its fundamental action, integrator or
coincidence detector is under question (König et al., 1996).
Once we learn how to read the streams of pulses, we can
capture the signal from any part of the brain and read
them as a language, if essential, we can talk to that part
in principle. As a first step, we invent a new type of sensor. In the day-to-day camera, or sound recorder, we store
the picture as is. Every visual image is divided into a 2D
array of pixels, and we store those pixels in the memory
device. The location of a pixel, the intensity and color corresponding to that pixel is stored in the 2D grid, we call it
“negative.” The original picture is recovered whenever that
is necessary as “positive.” For a sound recorder, similarly,
we store intensity and frequency exactly as is; the voice
stored as a stream of bits of information could be replayed
in the tape recorder whenever necessary. While generating an identical replica has been the fundamental inspiration behind human technology, nature has done something
completely different. The problem is that, when we look at
the pulses inside the brain, to us, electronic pulses coming from all organs look similar, neural code of events is
unknown (Mountcastle, 1967). In the last hundred year, scientists have tried to understand how these pulses are generated in the specific organ say eye, and almost all the person
who contributed fundamentally to this mission, have been
awarded the Nobel prize, however, the next step, how every
single information is exactly encoded in those streams of
pulses has not been understood. That means, if we put a
probe inside the brain, and we observe a stream of pulses,
they will mean nothing to us, we cannot read them, or even
tell whether it’s an optical data or sound (Carr, 1993). In this

Nanobrain

chapter, we will create a generic model of interpreting those
pulses to implement the information gathered to develop the
artificial brain like a computer.
Metabolism, plasticity and power consumption: in the
brain: Live video images of electric signal transport along
with the brain show that the total active area remains nearly
constant, it could possibly be due to a lossless energy transmission of energy packets across the brain. Widely distinct
metabolic and circadian clocks talk to each other (Asher
and Schibler, 2011), each rhythm compensate for the other’s
loss (Brinkmann, 1971; Chandrashekaran, 1974). Since solitons move with the velocity of sound resembling strongly to
the experimental observations, researchers have argued for
such a lossless transmission process in the brain. One additional argument for soliton-based transport comes from the
energy-expenditure calculation for the synaptic firing. We
do a simple calculation from the experimentally observed
data to estimate how much energy is required for the human
brain computing via synaptic junction firing, as the primary
process. Metabolic cost unifies all brain components to
deliver a scale-free feature (Hasenstaub et al., 2010). For a
single neuron firing, it is around 100–120 mV bias change
and the current change is 1–10 μA, which means the power
required is around 100 nW. There are around 1014 synaptic
junctions in the human brain, if say 1% of the total neurons
fire at a time, then it would require 100,000 watts; however,
the brain operates spending only ~20–25 watts. Let us get
deeper into this argument. A neuron hydrolyzes 1010 ATP
molecules per second to get its operational energy, which is
around 3 nanowatt power supply, considering 1011 neurons
in the brain, 1% of brain usage costs 3 watts. Since we know
very well that the brain uses an average of 25-watt power,
roughly we use 8% of the brain. The calculation seems to be
pretty convincing, however, we miss a very interesting part
of the story, neurons fire at a speed 1–40 Hz, what would
be the source of energy that sends signals to large distances
across the brain and asks them to fire? That process should
cost a minimal amount of energy per neuron (Suzana, 2011),
and minimum time, because chemicals to travel from one
end of the brain to another, it will take a very long time.
Conduction velocity of action potential = 0.6–120 m/s,
which is roughly the 30% of the velocity of sound, and neither ions can move this fast, nor electrons, if for the time
being we ignore than the magic of quantum mechanical
entanglement playing a role, then the only possibility left is
soliton which moves with the velocity of sound (Heimburg
and Jackson, 2005; Poznanski et al., 2017). The argument
inspired many to reject the firing-based computation protocol and implement an alternative (say soliton-based) computation. The question is that an engineer who wishes to
construct the brain must learn how to send the question to
all 100% audience, remaining silence is their choice, but that
does not mean, he won’t ask the question. Soliton is a nice
idea to interact, because, the sound vibration can travel all
around the brain with ease, if it matches with the encoded
resonance signatures it starts to vibrate resonantly (Suzana,
2011; Howarth, 2010).

7.1.2 Singularity on a Sphere—The Key
to a Clock of a Time Crystal
High-frequency oscillations nearly 1 kHz have been correlated to cognition, such high-frequency oscillations are at the
limiting time resolution of ionic impulses (Kucewicz et al.,
2014). One of the problems in explaining high-frequency ionic
transmission is that if pulse timing reaches the limit of ionic
transmission, and cognition arises in that time domain, the
controls must be happening at a faster time scale (Worrell
et al., 2008). However, the ionic transmission has reached
its limit, so we need another mode of communication. In the
existing neuroscience there is no provision for other modes of
communication. The geometric language that explores singularity enables complete shutdown of a particular vibrational
mode and the other unrelated mode to take over. The transition from one clock to another happens via a burst from
a singularity point (Figure 7.1g). One could represent a single clock with four singularity points at maximum using a
2 × 2 tensor. In Figure 7.1g, a diagonal is drawn to present
C2 symmetry of the clock and the structure that builds the
clock. One of the most exciting parts of the brain model is
one-to-one correspondence between shape and the symmetry,
but not the information content. The geometric shape of the
information is always invisible.
It is so beautiful to think that eye, skin, ear, nose, and
tongue all sensors get 11D information packet from nature
using a dodecanion tensor. One Bloch sphere presented in
Figure 7.1g cannot represent the whole brain but an elementary device, more spheres need to be connected to represent
complex information (Figure 2.2c). The mystery of the brain
is in the sensors, which use a pattern of primes to get back to
nature and ask external agent if some parts are missing could
it fill that gap. Think about 47 layers of Brodmann’s region
in the cortex. Because the ratios of the mean frequencies of
the neighboring cortical oscillators are not integers, adjacent
bands cannot linearly phase-lock with each other. Instead,
oscillators of different bands couple with shifting phases and
give rise to a state of perpetual fluctuation between unstable
and transient stable phase synchrony. It is true about the resonance chain too. The 1/fα power relationship among different layers in the brain implies that perturbations occurring at
slow frequencies can cause a cascade of energy dissipation
at higher frequencies, with the consequence that widespread
slow oscillations modulate faster local events. The scale
freedom, represented by the 1/fα statistics, is a signature of
dynamic complexity, and its temporal correlations constrain
the brain’s perceptual and cognitive abilities. The 1/fα (pink)
neuronal “noise” is a result of oscillatory interactions at
several temporal and spatial scales. Singularity is a filter to
noise.

7.2

PRIMES IN THE FIVE SENSORY SYSTEMS

All components described in Sections 7.2 through 7.5 were
built artificially using cables by Singh et al. (2018), and the
rhythms reported in the literature were regenerated in a large

183

device, before their miniature versions were incorporated into
the humanoid avatar described in Chapter 9. In all five sensors
a stream of electric pulse-based wave trains is created and
sent to the brain via a nerve bundle. First, all primary information is stored in the typical nature of the pulse (growth and
decay rate, amplitude and coupling of more than one pulse).
Second, gridding; it means 2D periodic pulses, each at the
corners of the four-sided cells that groups a set of information (Figure 2.8c, d). Third, several 2D pulse-streams are
superimposed on the background waveform; suitable filtering hardware could isolate each 2D pattern separately. Be it
sensory or memory, three protocols would build time crystals (Figure 2.6) and the corresponding garden of gardens of
meander flower (Figure 2.7c–e). Information is encoded in the
neural assembly by spike intervals; there are three kinds of
responses, mainly. First, “direct response to external stimuli”;
second, if the time gap is more between the spikes, then it
slowly adopts and then starts responding. There are two types
of adaptation, first, “build-up to the necessity,” wherein,
signal response increases as the number of pulse increases;
second, “bursting with a logical time crystal,” wherein alternative periods of responsive and silent modes are observed.
While describing the grammar of eye-pulse, tri-phase signals are used, tri-phase means two peaks with a negative
trough in between them, and the ratio between the crest and
trough stores a clock, multiple such sets build a time crystal.
The similar pulse signature is common to store and process
time crystals for all organs and neural assemblies.
Music and the human brain: Brain’s eye movement processing exhibits distributed parallel processing and tensor
theory is found to fit well (Anastasio and Robinson, 1990),
paving the way for the dodecanion tensor analysis. Just like
microtubule is the deserted DNA, it never got the honor it
should have received as the coder of metabolism of life, an
ear never gets that honor as the eye. The human brain stem,
a key center for consciousness shifts its activity significantly
with the complex sound (Erika and Nina, 2010). It suggests
that conscious human response is related to time crystals that
are key to the geometric structure of music. The ear is a fractal drum (Sapoval et al., 1991). Often it is shown that auditory cortex naturally processes key grammatical features of
music, as if it is designed to understand music (Elvira et al.,
2006; Large and Palmer, 2002). One-to-one correspondence
between the thought process of the brain during music and
auditory cortex supports this hypothesis (Zatorre and Halpern,
2005). Not just the brain stem, both left and right hemispheres
are seen to play musical notes (Tramo, 2001). Moreover, that
musical firing inside is also visible in EEG, one could find a
mathematical construct when EEG displays music like rhythmic tones in its behavior (Snyder et al., 2005).
Why do we have two ears, two eyes, two noses and a
symmetrically divided tongue and symmetrically divided
body for sensors? Each half produces a time crystal, when
combined, two-time crystals with C2 symmetry merge to
resolve the local very small size parts of the time crystals
that are not common between the two parts, which helps the
organ to analyze remarkable thing. For example, by merging,

184

Nanobrain

time crystals of eyes determine two angular parts in the brain
so that we can perceive the 3D image, two ears resolve the
distance from which the sound is coming. Two nostrils, one
remains wetter than the other, and they interchange this feature time to time, so in this way they change the molecular
detection efficiency, wet one gets the higher energy part of the
molecules and the dry one detects low energy parts of the molecules efficiently. Similarly, two symmetrically divided parts
of tongues tell us the gradient of different elementary tastes,
i.e., analog values in the detection scale. For the touch sensor, the symmetric body does the same—it creates a virtual
analog gradient of temperature sensitivity, moisture sensitivity, etc. Simultaneity in the sensory signals, e.g., audio-visual
simultaneity is essential for brain cognition, the non-linear
temporal pattern that emerges simultaneity (Benedetto et al.,
2018), demands a time crystal as if time really matters for all
sensors (Cariani, 1995).
The cognition via visual control system
[Vision Circuit → Optic Chiasm → Thalamus → Visual
Cortex → V1 → V2(complex shape, color) → V3(angle,
orientation) → V3a (motion + direction) → V5 (Parietal
lobe, fusion form gyrus)] Prime: 13, 7, 5, 11, 3: Detecting
(a)

a time crystal requires detecting a shift in the resonance
peaks (Groma et al., 2004). Only then the higher-level clocks
reveal themselves, it seems while engineering the human
eye 13 types of cavities work together to sense visual input
(Figure 7.2a). A clock needs feedback and a feedforward signal transmission, else the loop is not complete (Zipser and
Andersen, 1988). Such a network is shown in the visual cortex
domain (Michalareas et al., 2016) where five-fold symmetric
paths operate (C5). Temporal patterns are resolved by motionsensitive neurons in the primate visual cortex (Buracas et al.,
1998). The brain cannot process all objects accurately in a
particular visual image. Isolating the parts is equally important as conversion into time crystals since one need to pick up
what to process, at the same time, keeping an eye on the other
parts of the image. Asymmetry in the neuron geometry alone
cannot explain how eyes sense direction (Anderson et al.,
1999). While transcranial magnetic stimulation of the visual
pathway shows a periodic oscillation (Amassian et al., 1998;
Ilmoniemi et al., 1999). To build a time crystal, self-similar
arrangement of neurons is needed and at least cats visual cortex have it (Binzegger et al., 2005). Time crystal-like oscillation of these pinwheel arrangement is reported (Bonhoeffer

A Complete, Integrated Time Crystal Model of a Human Brain

and Grinvald, 1991). The orientation columns in the visual
cortex adopt unique geometries to sense projected signals
(Braitenberg and Braitenberg, 1979). Geometric arrangement
regulates phase-locking conditions between different visual
memories (Lee et al., 2005; Braitenberg and Schütz, 1998).
The combination of parallel and serial processing in the visual
cortex hinted toward a distributed computing (Bullier and
Nowak, 1995). The idea of a time crystal as a regulating factor
emerges from the temporal patterns of visual cortex (Buracas
et al., 1998). High-frequency rhythmic and non-rhythmic
signals engage in fast synchronization in the visual cortex
suggests a general principle that could govern spatiotemporal coding (Eckhorn, 2000). Low-frequency signals regulate
long-range synchronization (König et al., 1995). Together
they build a temporal architecture which controls visual form
that we see (Lee and Blake, 1999). Temporal architecture is
the visual form, because it can explain spontaneous bursts
with no trigger, even the bursts have topologies like stripes,
rings, spirals, etc. (Fohlmeister et al., 1995). One of the fundamental signatures of time crystal is temporal beating, i.e., the
frequency difference between two waves forms a new clock
(Hammett and Smith, 1994).
Seven columns of rhodopsin molecules with three color
sensing pigments convert light into electric pulses via 11C
chain molecules, we find C7, C3, and C11 symmetries operate in harmony. Irrespective of the nature of visual, seven
different kinds of electrical nerve pulses acquire all kinds of
visual information in the retina (Victor, 1999), which takes
part actively in shaping the 3D waveform sent to the brain
via eye-bundle of nerves. The pulses are connected to point
singularities and they distribute topologically (Tanaka, 1995),
to hold geometric information. Moreover, the axons in visual
cortex arrange in a fractal shape (Binzegger et al., 2005),
self-similarity helps in closing a time loop. There are several
different kinds of cells, which take part in the photon to a particular electronic pulse conversion process. The 3D waveform
is a 2D matrix with variable amplitude, the rate of change of
pulse with time contains the phase information and the base
of the 2D matrix simply provides the coordinates. Optical
illusions reveal such interactions (Tallon-Baudry et al., 1997).
2D matrices are continuously sent as time changes. We have
argued above that all sensory organs keep particular places
in the grid-free for others to contribute; the same principle
is applied for a large number of sensory cells in the eye too.
Thus, if sensory cells reach threshold and fire, contribution
automatically finds its place in the grid, thus, an automatic
classification for the dimension of an object, color, shape, is
made in the superimposed grid, as a dynamical organization
of clocks (Uusitalo et al., 1996).
Engineering the auditory system
[Auditory circuit → Organ of Corti → Cochlear
nucleus of spinal cord → Superior Olive (side of brain
stem) → Inferior Colliculus → thalamus → cortex]: Seven
tubes (C7) in the inner ear senses sound and keeps body’s
balance (Figure 7.2b). The cochlea has a triplet of triplet structure (C3). Within that structure five resonating parts transmit
sound for sense. Sound is required for enhanced perception

185

of reality (Johnson and Coxon, 2016). In the pattern of sound,
often, one could find geometric symbols hidden in the vibrations (Linton, 2009), geometric theory of auditory signals is
old (Licklider, 1959). Auditory signals are captured by giant
tuning forks located in the ear that vibrate resonantly with the
sound signal. Visual imaging of auditory signals shows classification (Tani et al., 2018) or nested groups. For all sensors, we
are using resonant oscillators, since the wavelength is less for
light (400–600 nm), the eye requires very small size molecular
optoelectronic resonant oscillators, but for sound wavelength
is large (300 m), therefore the drum required is quite large.
A large-scale coherent neural assembly operates connected
to the drum over a sub-second time frame (250–300 ms),
voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDI) provide high-sensitive (both
temporal and spatial) real-time imaging of the neural activity. While capturing visual signal, the human brain is most
sensitive at the point of stimulation, but for the auditory signal it is most active at the superficial layer, as the brain is
not interested in the spatial distribution of the auditory signal.
In addition, neural assemblies are organized in such a way
that, naturally, the visual neural assembly responds faster than
the auditory counterpart in the first 120 ms response time.
However, after 250 ms, the visual neural assembly response
falls sharply, while a linear increase in the signal response of
the auditory signal is observed. Signal integration time for the
auditory response is much larger than the visual one.
Deaf people convert sound into a sign language (Zaghetto,
2012). The sound could be sensed from anywhere; for example, whales hear the vibration of the skull (Cranford, 2015).
Even proteins are triggered by sound wave (Xiujuan et al.,
2003). Brain stem filters the complex sound into multiple
time-domain (Erika and Nina, 2010). Panoramic view of the
environment where the sound comes from originates in the
seven layers of brain cortex (C7), responsible cortical neurons
classify 360° views as time period of a clock (Middlebrooks,
1994). Auditory cortex not just builds electrical but a 10 Hz
magnetic rhythm (Lehtela et al., 1997). One requires three
rhythms electrical, magnetic and mechanical, for e − π − φ
control. To the right of Figure 7.2b, we have shown geometric
shapes for each auditory system in terms of primes. In GML,
3D geometric shape embedded in a time crystal is the control.
The fundamentals of the smell control systems
[Olfactory circuit → smell → Olfactory lobe of the limbic
system (looped around the primitive brain) → Amygdala
→ Cortex]: The nose was the first organ created during the
evolution of the animals. Therefore, its nerves are very close
to the brain-stem where from the fundamental control of our
body, heart-beating, lungs-breathing (respiratory rhythm,
Lewis et al., 1992; singularity in respiratory rhythm, Paydarfar
et al., 1986; geometry of respiratory rhythm, Sammon, 1994),
and motor nerves are controlled. On another planet, if the
environment is such that the touch is favored, one could find
touch controls near the brain stem. Temporal coding of odor
and music have a similar geometric structure in the brain
(Plailly et al., 2007; Wehr and Davidowitz, 1996a; Wehr and
Laurent, 1996b). Similar to the human nose, one could use a
“lock and key” principle of supramolecular chemistry, where

186

a single molecule could sense a particular smell-molecule.
Seven families of genes with 23 different types of receptors
follow 5 signal pathways to deliver the cognitive experience
of odor (Figure 7.2c). Each sensory cell has several fine hairlike cilia containing receptor proteins that are stimulated
by odor molecules, however, there is no permanent chemical change. Hence, a resonant and wireless communication
is triggered to sense odor molecules and then the locking is
removed. However, it embeds a special pulse-cluster synthesizer attached to the molecular sensor, for a particular kind of
smell a distinct spike-pattern or temporal architecture is created (MacLeod and Laurent, 1996). The number of activated
receptors determines the intensity of the stimulus, the layer of
neurons located beneath the sensory molecules in the olfactory bulb generates a synchronized wave (Onoda and Mori,
1980). These waves have been recorded in the electroencephalogram (EEG) tracings, rise in the wave-amplitude indicates
the intense sensation, and fall is caused by inhibition. Note
that EEG records information for thousands of cells at once
(Tani et al., 2018). Reinforcement technique is a beautiful feature of the nose; some neurons remain as a buffer between the
neurons in the bulb and the neurons of the olfactory cortex.
These buffer neurons activate suitably during training and
strengthen the connection for generating a complex signal
response, such that a species could have a peculiar sense of
a complex combination of smells. Thus, if trained a complex
smell signature could carry an extremely vital environmental
change or threat or even a very particular event, this tool could
alone serve as an extremely intelligent encoding machine.
The touch sensor controls
[Touch detection circuit → Touch bud → spinal cord →
thalamus → cortex]: Five types of touch sensors are distributed all over the body surface (Rose and Mountcastle, 1959),
and experiments have shown that the brain relies on the collective response of the touch sensors (Figure 7.2d) to create a
packet of time crystals regarding the body-shape that it needs
to protect under external attack. Touch sense is used to determine size, shape and texture of an object, and according to the
need, density, and pattern of distribution of sensors are varied
to sense more or less pain, and touch discrimination. A slight
movement of the body-hairs could sensitize the touch sensors
distributed all over the body; the whole body is divided into
particular regions in a very ordered fashion via 13 spinal tracts
of a neural network to transmit touch senses from individual
parts of the cortex via the spinal cord (Figure 7.2d). Temporal
synchronization is the key to a couple of touch sensors across
the body. By touch, the brain detects vibration (Keidel, 1984).
Touch sensors also require a permanent memory hardware
mechanism; therefore, it was involved in the process dozens
of chemical messenger and receptors to sustain pain if the
condition continues (Khamis et al., 2015), in the artificial
brain, we could altogether replace it with physical permanent
memory processing protocols as described in chapter three.
Information gathered from touch sensors requires three kinds
of responses, first, immediate response by moving a muscle
or the body-part, the decision is taken via spinal cord (Dorsal
horn loop). Second, pain message is sent to the brain, and

Nanobrain

instruction for inhibiting the excitation comes back, the process involves thalamus and cerebral cortex. Third, always,
for all kinds of pain and touch senses a part of the signal is
sent to the hippocampus and this particular brain stem region
controls complete situational analysis by sending it out to
the upper brain, cross-checking previous learning and then a
comprehensive decision is taken, output is sent to the cerebellum to execute action.
Engineering of the taste sensor controls
[Taste circuit → nucleus of solitary tract (brain stem)
→ thalamus → cortex]: In Chapter 9 we will describe training a nano-brain, arguing that an idiot baby brain gets trained
by following three basic desires of a life form, first, acquiring food; second, defending the safety of the body; and third,
taking reproductive measures. When a body looks for basic
foods, just to run the body, it does require the test buds to
cover a range of tastes that provides signature that the food
is suitable for the body or not, whether the food contains
more calories or not, even, the concurrent necessity of the
body could also be reflected in the tongue-sensory-response.
The tongue is a chemosensory assay of five basic tastes (C5);
each taste bud has sensory molecules with seven helical columns (C7), which adsorbs molecules (Figure 7.2e). Different
regions have distinct taste buds triggering both chemical and
non-chemical responses. Adapting to a particular taste always
decreases its sensitivity to a particular taste, and particular
chemical concentration always helps in reaching maximum
efficiency. The learning of the taste sensors has twofold
importance: First, if the sensors are exposed to the polarizing pre-conditioner, it acts as an exhibitor, the sensitivity
decreases; second, if the pre-conditioner is de-polarizer, then
it acts as an inhibitor and the sensitivity increases.

7.3 PRIMES IN THE CEREBELLUM,
HIPPOCAMPUS, AND HYPOTHALAMUS
Cerebellum: Cerebellum has 13 cavities that are filled
with a fractal neural net; the cavity boundary has seven layers and as a whole entire structure have generic seven major
folds (vertical cross-section), and two major fold in horizontal
cross-section (Figure 7.3a). It reads the final decision fractal
from the hippocampus and its hardware is a tree-like a fractal
network of neurons (Bell, 2002; Werner, 2010). Multiple generations of fractal wiring enable learning complex sequences
of mechanical movement coordination (Thach, 1998). It sends
extremely synchronized signals to all sensors for better data
capture for improving the decision-making process and
actions for the organs like a high precision machine (Eccles
et al., 1967). Since we use frequency fractal as a tool for
information processing and at the beginning of our discussion, we noted that we construct frequency fractals such that
if all time crystals from all sensors are fused; therefore, we do
not need additional hardware to identify which signal belongs
to which organs. A flat map reveals 2D one-to-many connections (Hurdal et al., 1999). When the final decisions come
from the hippocampus, mechanical movement controlled by

cerebellum assists in processing memory, a dual clock runs
(Gao et al., 2018). Depending on the length of signal travel
through the hippocampus if we connect the wiring with the
particular wires of the cerebellum, the right signal will reach
the right machine output.
Hippocampus: Hippocampus is made of 17 cavities,
wherein a pair of spiral pathways run in parallel side by side,
the parallel pathways have five-fold symmetries (Figure 7.3b).
Signals coming from entire body require performing two
vital tasks at hippocampus, the temporal code generator of
the brain (Buzsáki et al., 1994a) and it has its own long-term
memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993). Chemical rhythms
initiate a long-term memory (Kang et al., 1997; Ferbinteanu
and Shapiro, 2003). Temporal codes for each type of memory
is different (Leutgeb et al., 2005). First, a copy of the entire
information packet is glued here (Wallenstein et al., 1998),
like fusing all-time crystals, that final time crystal should be
radiated outside to the entire upper brain for matching with
previously gathered knowledge, so this device would work
as a helix antenna-receiver system. Following fast in fast

out principle it maintains the credibility of a pulse-packet
(Jonas et al., 2004). Hippocampus activates spontaneously at
a selected frequency band (Buño and Velluti, 1977). The second task would be continuously capturing the modified time
crystals from the higher brain as primary solutions, identifying the complementary time crystals and intelligent filtering
of entire input sets of time crystals at this place depending
on the sensory organs. The filtered time crystals, which do
not already exist in the brain, is then sent back to the specific
regions of the brain for the permanent storage and further processing (CA1 projections to entire cortex region; Cenquizca
and Swanson, 2007; Ciocchi et al., 2015). CA1 edits limiting
clocks, the fastest and the slowest, to regulate theta rhythm
(Rotstein et al., 2005). Electrical rhythms of hippocampus
reveal the rate of learning of the brain (Berry and Thompson,
1978). The very basic operation of artificial brain computing
is executed here in the helix antenna. Given the complexity
and reliability of the task needs to be performed here, we need
two antennas—one to send the incoming sets of time crystals
continuously to the upper brain (resource antenna, Fornix,

188

C7 symmetry, prime 7; Figure 7.3b), and the other to send the
complementary time crystals to different distinct parts of the
brain for saving it permanently (encoder antenna). To avoid
essential conflicts between the two jobs, two separate helical
antennas each with 37 rings (resource buffer and encoder buffer) in between. They resonantly communicate with the primary antennas spontaneously (Buño and Velluti, 1977) and
work as a buffer state provider, and since permanent writing
is done in the brain via wired transport, buffer antennas help
to sustain the pristine features of the information being processed in the primary antenna. Hippocampus is also a spatial
map generator of our environment (Blum and Abbott, 1996;
Frank et al., 2000) navigation and memorizing complex paths
work together (Buzsáki and Moser, 2013). Spontaneous activation and navigation happen in different frequency bands
(Buzsáki, 2005).
The basic architecture of hippocampus is a helix-shaped
molecular assembly with a large number of cables coming out of it radially at different parts of the helical length.
Assigning a phase by evaluating information properly is its
specialty (Kamondi et al., 1998). The cables and all parts
are made by neurons only in the real human brain; the
rest of the synthesis of all midbrain components are controlled by a particular frequency-modulated environment.
The basic principle of hippocampus design is “time delay is
proportional to the length of the wire the signal will travel”
(Buzsáki et al., 1992). Just based on this simple principle we
can fuse all different kinds of frequency fractals in it and at
the same time isolate them, categorize and send them back
to the particular specific region of the brain. An orthogonal pair of antenna (Gloveli et al., 2005) always radiates
out the signal as an electromagnetic energy packet, while
radiating out, the phase, frequency two essential features of
the time crystal are kept intact as an automated property of
the corresponding ionic wave; however, the delay or phase
modulation needs to be modulated by the hardware itself.
Electromagnetic sensitivity of hippocampus is well established (Maskey et al., 2010). Pyramidal cells are good in
phase adjustment (Harris et al., 2002), especially in the cortex, pyramidal neurons interact with inhibitory neuron to
edit a complex phase structure (Lytton and Sejnowski, 1991).
Now the helical path comes into action. More is the length or
number of loops in a helix, longer the signal should travel,
which would eventually increase the delay between the two
signals radiated out, thus, helical antenna sustains three fundamental features of a time crystal with absolute reliability.
At this particular point of time, a delay is a key, from which
sensory organs the signals are originated do not make any
difference (Amaral and Witter, 1989). Several clocks sync,
desync, build, and destroy clocks to operate hippocampus
(Buzsáki et al., 1994a). The streams of signals while entering into the brain, it is passed through the helical resource
antenna, at certain intervals or after a few helical loops, the
time crystals with shorter delay are extracted. Thereafter,
the signal left passes through another few loops, and then
the longer delayed signals are taken out and the process continues. Since a time crystal uses the delay or relative phase

Nanobrain

shift to differentiate between two distinct time crystals, the
length of the antenna is optimized to generate that particular
delay. Hippocampal place cells regulate neuron firing to edit
time (Royer et al., 2012), or even phase precession (Harris
et al., 2001, 2002). It could even get into an off-rhythm state
(Garcia-Sanchez et al., 1978), silence the synapses, and
downregulate systems (Norimoto et al., 2018).
If we simply pump in all signals as fractal seeds described
above (the fractal seed is the unit of information in the brain)
through the spring-like structure, and we take out an output
after every single loop, we can get signals with quantized
phase differences. Pattern completion is exclusive to the
CA3 region (Guzman et al., 2016). Self-assembled neurons
in four CA networks generate a unique spring in the hippocampus region as if four H3 layers of Hinductor device
based 2D sheets are packed together. Similarly, the nerve
fibers that connect pre-frontal cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, etc., all sub organs of the midbrain resemble H3 device-based 2D sheets (see Chapter 8 for details).
Before the memory information is sent all over the brain
for permanent storage, it is processed in the lower brain
hippocampus and converted into a set of patterns by massive compression (Skaggs et al., 1996). Grids do wonderful
things (Kraus et al., 2015). Then it sequentializes the learning process (Wallenstein and Hasselmo, 1997). The lower
brain region looks similar for every animal from dinosaur
to human, the information processing protocol for all animals is the same. If we enter inside the hippocampus, in
one of its four functional layers, the machinery looks like a
spiral ring and longitudinal connections exist all along with
the spiral net, a neuron pulse flows helically, when it collides with the longitudinal one, a particular phase is associated and helicity encodes particular frequency. Therefore,
this single machine prepares the information to categorize
them into particular classes, with a set of frequencies and
phases before sending them out to a distant location. In addition, whenever it would be necessary, with that particular
set of phase and frequency, it can recall them as a cognitive
graph (Muller et al., 1996). The machine is, therefore, phase
and frequency encoder. Positive and negative phase interact to
neutralize and regulate phase (Holscher et al., 1997). Phase
regulation means changing geometric shape in a time crystal, it is the coordinate (O’Keefe and Burgess, 1996).
The clock like periodic oscillations down-regulate the synapses (Norimoto et al., 2018). The connection of nerve fibers
that connects between the hippocampus and amygdala has a
typical geometric shape and it changes following a change in
geometric symmetry (Kishi et al., 2006). Slower clocks hold
phase information with clarity (Adey et al., 1960), clocks
autocorrect possibly guided by symmetry breaking of the
encoded information, i.e., integrating path and environment
cues interplay to find a major change in the ensemble code for
space (Gothard et al., 1996). A cortex network for memory,
navigation, and the perception of time, namely entorhinal system communicates with the hippocampus using theta rhythm
(Buzsáki and Moser, 2013; Buzsáki, 2005). Geometric structural symmetry of hippocampus in the CA1 region changes

A Complete, Integrated Time Crystal Model of a Human Brain

very little and that precise change reflects the projection of the
region to the entire cortex region (Cenquizca and Swanson,
2007) and projection neurons adopt a geometric symmetry
that enables it to filter information (Ciocchi et al., 2015), stable
under massive noise (Zugaro et al., 2005).
The operational mystery of real hippocampus is unresolved, the dynamic data flow appears like checkerboard like
a grid of pulses or metric (Terrazas et al., 2005) propagating across the hippocampus and on top of that grid, another
stream of water like waves flow. Geometric shapes of hippocampal oscillations during sleep carries the geometric language embedded within (Staresina et al., 2015). The phase
relationship between hippocampal place units and the EEG
theta rhythm suggests that for each brain decision the stream
flowing on a grid protocol remains the same, throughout
(O’Keefe and Recce, 1993). The biggest question that should
disturb us, is regarding the origin of this gridding of information. If it is not done at the very moment when information
enters in our body, it is just impossible to compartmentalize
them later in the brain wherein the streams of pulses are coming in from all over the body. The homogenizing gap between
spikes is one key to regulate time (Vida et al., 2006). Thus,
the biggest problem we are facing in resolving the mysterious
information processing of the hippocampus is hidden in the
skin, eye, nose, ear, and in the tongue, not in the brain. It is so
exciting to feel that the biggest problem of the brain’s information processing is distributed throughout the body, not just
in the brain.
Hypothalamus: Hypothalamus in a normal human brain is
used for vital motor controls and generate rhythms. It is made
of 13 cavities (Figure 7.3c). Bidirectional feed-forward electromagnetic signaling observed in the hypothalamus is evidence
of clocking regulation of metabolism (Stanley et al., 2016).
These programmed activities are not essential for the computer we want to build; however, it is the supreme authority, if
we want highest-level transformation in the final decision fractal in the hippocampus, then we can program those protocols
here. The neurons are self-assembled similar to an LC-coupled
oscillator-type periodic fractal seed generator and an antenna
made of a neuron that transforms the final decision fractal within
the certain limits. It is the interfacing point of the user modulating the computational process in the artificial brain.
Thalamus: Thalamus is a gateway to the sensors, a gateway
to the brain cortex (Sherman and Guillery, 2002) and a gateway to the cerebellum. It is made of 13 cavities (Figure 7.3d)
and acts as a universal synchronizer (Steriade and Deschenes,
1984) that builds a natural logarithmic relationship in the
frequency distribution among various brain components
(Penttonen and Buzsáki, 2003). The machine looks like as if
many springs are side by side, if one of them is triggered then
a complex vibration is automatically triggered over the entire
system. Each spring-like structure accepts the particular kind
of sensory signals. Visual information is encoded as an architecture of time here (Reinagel and Reid, 2000). Thalamus
works with basal ganglia (Morison and Basset, 1945).
Fornix: Fornix dynamics follows a C7 symmetry
(Figure 7.4a), it is the antenna and receiver of time crystal

189

between the midbrain and the upper brain (Raslau et al., 2015),
built-in a triangular network T1, T2, and T3 (Figure 7.4a).
Neocortex and hippocampus have competing learning mechanisms that work in a complementary way (McClelland et al.,
1995). Cingulate gyrus in the fornix is the key antenna receiver
complex of the brain’s learning. The interplay between hippocampus and cortex self-organizes time crystal and indexes the
memories (Miller, 1989).
Connectome: Connectome is the fiber pathways of the
brain (Schahmann and Pandya, 2006). There are five distinct
pathways of nerve fibers (C5, Figure 7.4a). However, during
functional imaging we find that T1, T2, and T3 domains of
connectome triggers five regions or seven regions in a geometric shape (Figure 7.4, bright domains with a dark background). At the bottom part of Figure 7.4a we demonstrate
projection seven-fold to the cortex. Functional logic for the
five-fold and seven-fold cortical connections is established
(Zeki and Shipp, 1988).
Cortex: The phase modulation of the propagating waves
in the cortex is important for time crystal analysis, similar
periodic behaviors are noticed in the network (Sanchez-Vives
and McCormick, 2000). Cortical rhythms of various kinds
are controlled by thalamus directly (Ralston and AjmoneMarsan, 1956). However, long back a map of the 2D phase
change profile was accounted for the decision-making of the
human brain in the cortex (Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001).
Earlier, the same group argued for learning by phase change
(Ermentrout and Kopell, 1994), which is again a key to establishing time crystal, GML-based learning of human brain.
Circuital changes were attributed to Darwinism (Edelman,
1987), which may be replaced by collective cooperation in
future. High frequency, 200 Hz, focal synchronization of ripples in the neocortex (Grenier et al., 2001), may include spiral
waves (Huang et al., 2010) in time crystal GML, we may call
it, fusion of time crystals. It is also reported that neocortex
codes space using architecture of time (Singer, 1994). Gray
matter and white matter of cortex are connected by universal scaling law (Zhang and Sejnowski, 2000). Cerebral cortex holds a deep 3D architecture of phase to regulate the alfa
rhythm (Lopes da Silva and Storm van Leeuwen, 1978). Intracortical and thalamocortical, two distinct time crystals interact which reflects in the alfa rhythm (Lopes da Silva, et al.,
1980). Different cortical regions have discrete rhythms, which
integrate, build higher-level rhythms and that higher-level
temporal architecture is the global landscape of cognition
(Taylor et al., 2015). These cortical convolutions (Tallinen
et al., 2016) are vortex atom-like structures representing the
mind.
Pre-frontal cortex: Pre-frontal cortex controls futuristic
simulations remaining phase-locked with the hippocampus
(Siapas et al., 2005). The region is directly connected to the
frontal lobe where the highest-level fractal seeds are stored
as compressed data (Nieder and Miller, 2003). However, this
region captures the final fusion fractal which is the solution
of the computation carried out in the brain and concentrates
only on the “then” related “action” parts, which the body will
execute. Then it feeds higher-level time crystals stored in the

frontal cortex to generate “futuristic simulation” of the actions
in the hippocampus. The hardware is made of two antenna
and receivers coupled with each other. First with one antenna
it reads the “action to be taken” parts of the frequency fractal,
matches with the higher-level rules “if” clusters, as soon as it
matches, then those phase transition rules are sent to the hippocampus for transforming the final decision-making fractal.
Thus, futuristic thoughts or imaginations are generated with
this neuron-made hardware. As this region expands the final
frequency fractal in the hippocampus, the hippocampus sends
it back to all over the brain and executes significant modifications in the final frequency fractals.
Spinal cord: Thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves come from
all over the body in five domains (C5, Figure 7.4b) to reach
sensory signals high up the brain, and 31 pair motor nerves
to carry brains execution order. We might notice the fantastic
use of primes in the branching of spinal responses. Even if

there is no firing in the medulla and in the spinal cord, there
is a rhythmic neuronal discharge to compensate the signaling (Ren et al., 2006), which suggests that there is firing or
not, rhythmic or clocking responses generate perpetually in
the spinal cord. Its geometric information is so profound that
rebuilding initiates spontaneously (Mackinnon et al., 2012).
Amygdala: Seven cavities of Amygdala work in harmony
(Figure 7.4c). Amygdala and hippocampus work together to
store a typical face and word (Heit et al., 1998), retrieving fear
memory (Seidenbecher et al., 2003) geometric projection from
the hippocampus to the amygdala is significant (Kishi et al.,
2006). The circuits between the duo tell an emotional story
of logic. Emotional differences are the differences between
architectures of time (Schmidt and Trainor, 2001). In the time
crystal model of a human brain model amygdala implements
the complex filtering process. Amygdala’s structural geometry and behavioral response are closely related, and that

191

regulates amygdala hippocampus circuit (Yang and Wang,
2017). During a decision-making process, the human brain
receives the final time crystal in the hippocampus, which contains all possible decisions and solutions, the design of amygdala hardware is such that it generates a set of unique fractal
seeds that reads particular signatures in any other fractals and
according to its list of preferences, it deletes unacceptable
choices or fractal seeds. In other words, the amygdala sends
a fractal to the hippocampus and that fractal checks coexistence of conflicting geometries (multiple opposite choices
in the solution of a problem) and then it simply deletes the
unfavored ones. To simply understand what happens mirror
symmetry or C2 symmetry is detected. Basic drives for a life
form is a triangle for giving birth, effort to save life, arranging
food for regeneration of cells remains saved in the amygdala
with birth and evolves with our life practices, so evolution of
a time crystal of desires from a single triangle to a superposition of a large number of triangles in a single plane, it looks
like a lotus flower. Such an emotional bonding makes memory
permanent (Paré et al., 2002). Top-down control of fear and
anxiety (Adhikari et al., 2015). Reward system acts in correlated clocking with ventral striatum (Cador et al., 1989), while
the network of clocks or time crystal for processing emotion
works in a loop with the pre-frontal cortex (Delli Pizzi et al.,
2017). Geometric conversation, or exchange of geometric
shapes between multiple components, e.g., between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in a periodic sequence determine
emotions (Ghashghaei et al., 2007). Since the symmetry of
lotus is very different for different humans, the orange or
mango is different for every single person on the planet.
Twelve cranial nerves: Phase coupling between cranial
nerves (e.g., vagus with sinus node; Jalife and Moe, 1979)
and the local time crystals initiate a higher-level time crystal
synthesis. Cranial nerves in the midbrain arranged in three
cavities, in the first cavity two (two cavities vibrate around a
center, 2 + 1 = 3 dynamic points), in the second cavity there
are five nerves (5 × 2 + 1 = 11), in the third cavity there are four
nerves (4 × 2 + 1 = 9), total dynamic centers 3 + 11 + 9 = 23,
and one nerve is left out, it runs separate (Figure 7.4d, e).
Basal ganglia: Basal ganglia made of seven cavities
(Figure 7.4f) perform procedural learning, or learning by
practice, it finds time crystals that are good, bad, and ugly
for a task (Boraud et al., 2005). The organ modifies the final
decision-making frequency fractal of hippocampus so that
a very systematic input is captured and the brain jelly could
reconfigure the neural circuit concretely, its motto for practice is to “loving it” (Graybiel, 2005). Therefore basal ganglia generate a new kind of frequency fractal that enables it
to control multiple sets of solutions generated by the brain at
an interval of 200 ms, it keeps continuation among the discrete computational input-output process. The hardware necessary for this is the creation of a fractal and then run it in a
loop longer than 200 ms so that it affects the self-motivated
data acquisition process continuously. Failing to automation
leads to Parkinson’s disease (Brown, 2003). However, there is
another important aspect of it, how would the fractal nature
be determined? Unlike previously described organs, in this

case the fractal nature is not pre-programmed. In fact, prefrontal cortex simulates futuristic outcomes and if the final
decision fractal before and after futuristic simulation suggests
missing of significant “then” correlated data, then that event
is captured by the basal ganglia and it generates a continuous
relevant data capturing job.
The brain stem is the region that exhibits the best example of “one-to-many and many-to-one” network, along with
hippocampus it controls theta rhythm (Vertes and Kocsis,
1997). In the human brain, the pinnacle of the spinal cord
(Hindu literature call this maha-siva-pada, it senses the most
complex sound of the universe, Erika and Nina, 2010) holds
the brain-stem cells, it is surrounded by a cavity holding the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Every movement of the body needs
a local motor clock activation (Sanes and Donoghue, 1993),
every learning of motor operation is a synthesis of rhythm
or clock (Sakai et al., 2004). The liquid of CSF dumps the
vibrations generated by any physical shock, e.g., noisy ripples
generated by heartbeat, lung rhythms, and motor nerve controlling units. Motor nerve control units are essential for the
automated learning feature development and lungs control
may not be essential if an analog of heartbeat control takes
care of the entire energy supply. Regarding motor nerve controlling, brain-stem cells should run a synchronous rhythm
wave, which should run perpetually as a controlled operation.
The rhythmic program should not be modified or re-written,
even if it is switched off, after switching on the same programmed rhythm would start running perpetually. That
incredible feature enables finding the geometric difference
between the two architectures of time. It means it divides twotime crystals instantly, it is the creator of new unprecedented
architectures of time (Carr and Konishi, 1990).

7.4 PRIMES IN THE CONNECTOME,
SPINAL CORD, AMYGDALA, NUCLEUS,
AND CORTICAL COLUMN
Nucleus: Nucleus are bodies with autonomous firing abilities (Figure 7.4g), it is so robust that if necessary, act as
a pacemaker (Bal and McCormick, 1993). Though small
in size, a large number of neurons coexist in different
structural symmetries just like stem cells (Hassan et al.,
2009), the organization is adaptive to any change in symmetry (Scheibel and Scheibel, 1966). Plasticity of nucleus
architecture is enormous. Suprachiasmatic nuclei control
sleep, but if one deprives sleep, the nuclei change its structure (Deboer et al., 2003). GABA receptors control the
clocks of suprachiasmatic nuclei (Liu and Reppert, 2000);
GABA not only syncs but desyncs clocks too (Llinás et al.,
2005). Generally sleep rhythm is created by thalamic
and neocortical rhythms (Steriade et al., 1993a, 1993b).
The geometry of the nucleus plays a vital role in its time
crystal processing, the topological architecture of information is key (Phillipson and Griffiths, 1985). Most nuclei
that are clusters of neurons activate the action potential and
initiate the propagation of clocking waves spontaneously

192

or autonomously (Atherton et al., 2008). Nuclei are good
in regulating spindle rhythmicity, which means multiple
strings or protein fibers could be triggered simultaneously
into a coherent oscillation (Destexhe et al., 1994). If the
nucleus is disconnected, the collective spindle oscillations
disappear (Steriade et al., 1985). Spindle oscillations help
in simultaneous management of many neural firing (Wang
and Rinzel, 1993). A nucleus could act as a catalyst, programmed to trigger a local or a cascade of global events
like arousal (Lewis et al., 2015). A nucleus could be programmed for a sequence of geometric codes to activate a
particular switch of events (Phillipson and Griffiths, 1985).
It is like encrypted engine. The nucleus is best bet for phase
reset, key to time crystal (Field et al., 2000).
Cortical column: Cortical column has seven layers. It generates a magnetic field (Arlinger et al., 1982;
Figure 7.4h), and it generates temporal structures like a
song (Ikegaya et al., 2004), which makes it a fit candidate
for the third generation Hinductor fourth-circuit element as
described in the Figure 7.11. As noted, the first-­generation
elementary decision-making device H1 of the brain is
microtubule, its three layers are water crystal inside the hollow cylinder made of tubulin proteins, the upper water layer
is also important. The second generation of decision-making
device H2 is the filamentary bundles made of microtubule,
actin and intermediate filaments as the first layer. Then above
this axon core there is a 2D ordered net of beta-­spectrin and
actin filaments which anchors multiple proteins. Finally,
the third layer is a composition of glial cells, neurons, and
oligodendrocytes building a nerve fiber or cortical column.
The third generation of decision-making device H3 is a cortical column made tract, sheet, fiber, using hexagonal close
packing of columns, i.e., 7, 19, 37….number of columns
are used. The second layer is made of 19 groups of 7 column units. The third layer is 47 groups of 37 column units,
thus, Brodmann’s 47 regions are covered (Brodmann, 1909;
Garey, 2006). Radial Unit Hypothesis (RUH) is a conceptual theory of cerebral cortex development, first described
by Rakic (1988). Radial glial cell hypothesis is important
for evolution, which uses glial cells as evidence of the evolution of the cortical column. In the mainstream neuroscience
the true role of a cortical column is not known (Horton and
Adams, 2005). However, in the time crystal model of the
brain, a cortical column processes an octonion, H2 while
a single microtubule a quaternion H1, and the cortex layers
47 Brodmann’s region all together represent a dodecanion.
In a time crystal, actually multiple infinite wave trains are
encoded. To understand its hidden information content,
the brain has to split an infinite wave-train into multiple
segments, dendritic branches in the cortical column could
segmentize the temporal signals with a particular pattern
(Branco et al., 2010). It is when a brain begins to understand the information content. Similar H3 devices are there
at many places, especially in the hippocampus.
One of the finest debate about the cortical column is
that whether remaining within the hexagonal close packing, a single cortical column could operate independently

Nanobrain

or collective response is the only way out (Gawne and
Richmond, 1993). The debate turns interesting because the
cortical neurons find symmetric and asymmetric division
zones and migrate through various phases (Noctor et al.,
2004).

7.5 PRIMES IN THE NEURON, GLIA,
DENDRO-DENDRITIC, ASTROCYTES,
MICROTUBULE, AND PROTEINS DNA
The physicist Paul Nuñez pioneered rigorous applications of physical wave propagation theories to brain waves
(Nuñez, 1981, 1998). Physics provides a vast toolbox for
treating wave phenomena mathematically. These techniques have provided some understanding of global brain
phenomena in terms of the physical properties of its carrier medium. How far can we go with this physicist’s view
of the brain? While medium filtering is an important factor, it cannot explain the larger spatial extent of neuronal
recruitment at lower frequencies or the behavior-dependent
highly coherent gamma oscillations in distant brain areas
(König et al., 1995, 1996; Varela et al., 2001). Libet’s principal finding was that short trains of pulses evoked only
unconscious functions, and the somatosensory cortex
had to be stimulated for 200–500 milliseconds for evoking a conscious sensation of touch. This time-domain has
sub-domains (Nicolelis et al., 1995). To become aware
of a sensory experience requires the engagement of the
appropriate brain networks for hundreds of milliseconds.
The delay between Libet’s “mind time” relative to physical time is a favorite argument of philosophers to question the unity of the mind and brain (Libet, 2004). Some
form of noise is included in all models to mimic the highly
variable spontaneous spiking activity present in the intact
brain (e.g., Usher et al., 1994). Some networks with sparse
connectivity can generate irregular spike trains, chaos into
organized clock network (van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky,
1996; Amit and Brunel, 1997). However, these models are
less sensitive to input perturbations and are quite unstable.
Models of single oscillators, on the other hand, are too stable, and without some external noise, the spike patterns are
very regular. Voltage fluctuations in real neurons are limited by conductance increase that accompany the synaptic
activity. Therefore, it seems unlikely that synaptic activity
can generate large enough white noise-like variability to
sustain activity in model networks. Hippocampal regulation of rat’s anterior eye chamber during its early development shows patterns of neural communication (Bragin
and Vinogradova, 1983). The burst/pause patterns of cortical slabs resemble “slow 1” oscillation (Timofeev I. et al.,
2002; slow 1 oscillation is a novel rhythm of cortical brain
that leads to a steplike change in the membrane potential
of the neocortical pyramidal neurons from −70 to −80
millivolts to spike threshold) for the plasticity of cortex
or epileptic discharges. Traub and Wong (1982) provide a
quantitative explanation for the avalanches in the model

networks, it is important to know that over synchronization
is a failure in computation. In preventing population bursts,
subcortical neurotransmitters flow pattern play a vital role
(Steriade and Buzsáki, 1990).
The neurons: Twenty-three types of distinct geometries
of neurons are reported thus far, which delivers a distinct
electromagnetic resonance (Figure 7.5a). Oscillator like the
resonance of neurons with multiple dynamic modes (Wang,
1994) is responsible for neural information processing was
proposed long back (Llinás, 1988). It harvests channel noise
(White et al., 2000) to build organized clock, a transition from
random time slices to ordered architecture of time (Enright,
1980), the effect of noise in modulating neuron’s frequency
response is significant (Brunel et al., 2001), it figures out
space using time (Ahissar and Arieli, 2001). Though Ghosh
et al. advocated time crystal like the architecture of neurons
(2016), the transition of spike model to clock model of neuron started long back (Aviel and Gerstner, 2006). The fact
that each neuron has the fastest clock and a slowest limiting
clock that govern its temporal sensitivity, the neuron is a phase

editor (Lundstrom et al., 2009). Neural discharge is connected
to phase, (Andersen and Eccles, 1962) and they exhibit circadian rhythms (Benson and Jacklet, 1977). Time crystal model
makes a significant shift in the established concept of a neuron, because in the conventional model of a neuron, the Ca++,
Na+ and K+ ionic channels control the membrane potential
and that explains neuron firing. We include an additional factor, the electromagnetic oscillations of the microtubule bundle
as a secondary control parameter of firing. It regulates the
architecture of time of a neuron (Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis,
1968). When neuron switches its conductance very fast,
spontaneous ripples generate (Connor, 1978), similar to time
crystal measurement. Conversely, perturbation inhibits learning (Choe et al., 2016). Microtubule of specific length has
a specific resonance band (some peaks are prominent some
gets dormant), thus, brain, during its circuit evolution choose
compositions of different microtubule lengths to generate a
complex signal transmission behavior that eventually governs
the membrane potential distribution and sets the statistical
distribution of the different ion channel percentage, wherein

194

fractal feature is evident (Liebovitch et al., 1987). The filaments regulate subthreshold communication (Ghosh et al.,
2016a; Jin et al., 2012). Subthreshold communication is key
to the central nervous system communication (Llinás, 1988;
Laughlin and Sejnowski et al., 2003). The skeleton of the
entire neuron body turns alive via microtubule and no matter
how far the axons extent, the entire pathway of a giant network of a neuron cell works as if a single molecule. The giant
network expresses itself with large spikes (Lewandowska
et al., 2015). Basal bodies like the number game, assembly of
neurons like the game of integers because the microtubules
are packed inside (Pearson and Winey, 2009). The number
games of neurons have been a subject of study (Williams and
Herrup, 1988). Organoids model the migration of neurons
as part of number game (Xiang et al., 2017). The architecture of spatial arrangement and the architecture of temporal
arrangement go hand in hand (Buzsáki and Chrobak, 1995).
Geometric pattern or clique of neural assembly provides the
missing link between structure and function (Blaustein et al.,
2017). “Functions follow form” is an old debate (Connors
and Regehr, 1996).
The geometry of neural branches select a suitable set of
frequencies (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000), geometry sets
transmission rules (Rall, 1959). Why do neurons need thousands of branches? The reason could be sequential memory
(Hawkins and Ahmad, 2016) or time crystal processing,
where singularities on a single host clock are sequential
memory, while one inside another it simultaneous memory.
They compartmentalize plasticity (Losonczy et al., 2008).
Electronic clocks disrupt ionic clocks (Hormuzdi et al.,
2001), electromagnetic clocks trigger electronic clocks in
the biomaterials, therefore, the intra-clock transmission is
feasible. Without flowing neurotransmitters through synapses one could fire a neuron by sending electronic current
(Jefferys, 1995). Even a single protein synthesis inhibitor
could modify the circadian rhythm of a neuron (Jacklet,
1977). Neuron circuit generated geometric asymmetry is
not enough to explain the directional responses of neurons
in the visual cortex (Anderson et al., 1999). Thenceforth
Singh et al. explored the symmetry of geometric shapes hidden in the temporal architecture revealed in a large set of
spikes, group of groups of spikes, the answer to all mysteries
hides there (Singh et al., 2018). Hierarchical multi-layered
control on the neuron spikes timing requires a cascade
model, as additional support, the Hodgkin Huxley model
alone does not explain neuron firing (Aviel and Gerstner,
2006). Even a neuron creates the perception of 3D space
that we see around us by editing the time gap between two
spikes (Ahissar and Arieli, 2001). Sync and desync organize
together (Gray, 1994). Neurons are filled in a cavity and then
all neurons dance to the resonant modes of the cavity building all the architectures of the brain, from cortical column
to the hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord. The geometry
or clique of neuron holds the missing link between a neurons structure and its function (Blaustein et al., 2017). Thus,
the time has come to go beyond the Hodgkin Huxley doctrine started by Lapicque in 1907 (McCormick et al., 2007).

Nanobrain

Questions are plenty. Why did nature invent more than 120
neurotransmitters if all it had to do was execute a simple
job—fire or not fire. Neurotransmitters are neutral and thousands of branches fire in a group; some remain silent, some
fire, thus it is not a simple brute transmission (Sanes and
Lichtman, 1999). Following time crystal hypothesis every
decision-making unit in the brain should follow e − π − φ ,
mechanical-electrical-magnetic resonance. Neurons exhibit
magnetic resonance (Long et al., 2015).
Neuroglia: There are 23 types of glial cells or astrocytes
found in the brain (Figure 7.5b). Biologically, a neuroglia
performs several tasks (cleaning neuron cell deposits, etc.),
however, in the human brain model, wherein computing is
the key, the neuroglia works as a synchronizer, we ignore
other jobs as those are not directly related to the computing of the brain. In the human brain, neuroglia and neuron
are in a ratio 2:1. To remarkably speed up the long-distance
chemical communication, the brain needs signal amplifiers
and in the geometric human brain model the neuroglia is
an essential buffer engine that delivers homogeneity in the
potential gradient produced by individual neurons in the
neural network. It is a multi-functional resonant oscillator
is constructing the neuroglia. The fundamental electronic
property of this material would be receiving any band of the
electromagnetic signal emitted from the neurons and then
radiating it out all over the environment, thus working similar to an amplifier in the conventional power transmission
lines. It is essential to maintain the homogeneity of the electrical potential distribution in the entire frequency fractal
hardware. It is therefore computationally equally important
to the neurons.
Astrocyte based connectors: In the emergency situations,
astrocytes regenerate the neurons, in an environment just
like the glial cells they hold the time crystals for the localized regions, therefore when the time comes to recreate the
neurons cells, the circuit is ready with them. Eleven types of
oligo-dendrocytes, dendrocytes, and associated connections
are found in the brain (Figure 7.5c). Astrocytes regulate daily
rhythms working in tandem with the suprachiasmatic nuclei
(Tso, 2017). Surprisingly in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, astrocytes form gap junctions, wiring, network, but not neurons
(Welsh and Reppert, 1996).
Nerve fiber and microtubule: These are not cables.
Periodic changes in the periodic oscillations of the transmitted signals means, there exists an architecture of clocks
(Arshavsky et al., 1964). A cut in the nerve reveals various kinds of nanowires, microtubule (25–30 nm wide),
actin (2–4 nm wide) and neurofilaments (10–15 nm wide).
Thousands of these skeleton-like filaments were considered
silent, now Sahu et al. (2013a, 2013b) and Ghosh et al. (2016a)
have proved that they transport signals and regulate neuron
firing. On microtubule, one could select a variable spiral pitch
and generate different kinds of signals (Figure 7.5d), thus,
microtubule could hold a wide range of primes for resonance
(see Chapter 6 for details).
Proteins: Beta sheets of protein isolate alfa helices as per
STM studies (Sahu et al., 2013a, 2013b; Figure 7.5e), these

A Complete, Integrated Time Crystal Model of a Human Brain

clusters act as a cavity. 26,000 proteins of the PDB database
was searched to find that only up to 19 cavities are there in
nature (see details in Chapter 6).
DNA and RNA: Prime numbers are abundantly observed
in the genetic codes of DNA, amino acid code harnesses
the symmetry of primes (Lam, 2014; Yan et al., 1991;
Figure 7.5f). Micro-RNAs play a fundamental role in micromanaging the circadian clocks, biological timekeeping may
go down further below (Mehta and Cheng, 2012). Genetic
and nucleosome positioning codes are filtered and function
wise segmented, the classification follows the symmetry of
primes (Mossallam et al., 2016). Choice of codons, its binding symmetry evolves proteins (Stergachis et al., 2013). Genes
have circadian rhythms and those clocks show aging effect
(Yi et al., 2016), autoregulation of periodic genes (Sehgal
et al., 1995). DNA, RNA proteins have interstitial water and
they may act as time crystal alone (Mendonca and Dodonov,
2014). Using genetic alphabet one could synthesis artificial
life (Zhang et al., 2016).

7.6 TWELVE WAYS OF MEMORIZING
AND TWELVE CARRIERS OPERATING
RHYTHMS/CLOCKS
Vibrations hold the key to everything. Until now, we were
considering that vibrations and rhythms are the only keys
to some enzyme cycles, periodic discharge with periodic input is what makes neuron a clock (Rescigno et al.,
1970). But the PPM-GML-H triad proposal is that deep
down below even to the molecular scale there are rhythms.
The current extrapolation is an advancement of Adaptive
Resonance Theory (Carpenter and Grossberg, 2003): Brain
regions that are functionally described include visual and
auditory neocortex; specific and nonspecific thalamic
nuclei; inferotemporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal,
hippocampal, parahippocampal, perirhinal, and motor cortices; frontal eye fields; supplementary eye fields; amygdala; basal ganglia: cerebellum; and superior colliculus,
Thalamic nuclei. In the (adaptive resonance theory) ART
all kinds of resonances have no relation in between, here
all resonances are geometrically connected. The origin
of scale-free brain activity is the correlation between
the architecture of the time and the architecture of spatial arrangement (He et al., 2010). Twelve years of electrical turbulence evolve the system (Winfree, 1998), thus
12 is important. Event-specific changes in brain rhythms
reveal that memory is dynamic, it has a structure of clocks
(Bastiaansen and Hagoort, 2003).
Retrieving a memory has been a subject of interest for
centuries, it haunts us (Sara, 2000). The geometry of time
to recall is created when theta and beta rhythms encode
memory (Sederberg et al., 2003). Theta rhythms of neurons
build wide ranges of brain functions (Vinogradova, 1995).
Alfa rhythm associated memory is a fractal structure, for
a baby, it is localized, for an adult, its global (Srinivasan,
1999). And there are 12 types of memories that work at the

195

12 scales of operations in the brain (Figure 7.6). All memories are geometric in nature:
1. Periodic memory: Chain of guitar string we see
mostly in DNA, proteins, a period of periods in the
nodes of the string. Edit the memory by changing the
periodic length of elementary point oscillators.
2. Spiral of spiral memory, in DNA and proteins, also
in microtubules. Edit the memory by changing the
twists and the number of hierarchical periods by
inducing more and more twists.
3. Vector memory, the orientation of helices to make
cavities inside the protein. 3D orientation makes it
a multipolar complex 3D vibrational element. Edit
the memory by changing the orientation of column
oscillators.
4. Lattice memory, microtubule, actin-beta spectrin
network, protein complex. Change the lattice parameters to edit the memory.
5. Chemical-electric memory, chemical transmission
cycles. There are nested time cycles highly interconnected, to edit the memory, change the diameter,
phase, delay or starting points.
6. Leak density of cavity memory, ion diffusion holes
in the cellular membrane. To edit the change in
memory the leak density on the cavity surface.
7. Spiral geometric memory, assembly of neurons,
etc. To edit the memory, change the pitch-diameterlength of the spiral.
8. Vortex or fractal memory, memory stored in the geometric parameters of the vortex. A vortex has divergence parameters and scale repeat unit, these two
parameters are changed to edit memory.
9. Nodal and polar memory: Nodes in the spinal cord
brain network (nodes in a teardrop). The geometry of
the shapes is changed among eight different choices
from teardrop to ellipsoid to edit nodes and polarity
memory.
10. Electromechanical phase memory: organs sync and
desync like a giant molecule. The memory is edited
by changing the bond length or wiring length and
distribution.
11. Multipolar loop in phase space loop memory: hyperspace memory. The memory is non-physical and
hence not editable.
12. The phase of phase duality generator memory:
the hierarchical assembly of the reality sphere.
The memory is non-physical and hence not editable.
Rhythms in the brain or thoughts are nonlinear (Stam et al.,
1999), they are not only one type. Large-scale models of the
brain have been proposed to resolve the cognitive and systems
issues in neuroscience (Eliasmith et al., 2012). It has been
argued that transient dynamics of the neural network would
resolve this issue (Rabinovich et al., 2008). It has been established now concretely that greater similarities in neural pattern across repetitions are associated with a better memory

FIGURE 7.6 A chart is showing 12 different possible ways to build time crystals, their editability, and location.

(Xue et al., 2010). Sound is a mechanical rhythm and we
have 12 different rhythms in the brain which differs in normal and pathological functions (Schnitzler and Gross, 2005;
Figure 7.7), which ensures burst or not to burst (Steriade,
2001) at all levels:
1. Electromagnetic rhythm (carrier is photon or electromagnetic wave is trapped in a cavity to generate
beating or rhythm).
2. Magnetic rhythm (spiral flow of electrons or ions,
they are the carriers editing the magnetic flux, the
geometry of path forms the periodicity).
3. Electrical potential rhythm (change in the arrangement of dipoles editing the electric field, fractal distribution of local resonators generate a time function
of potential).
4. Solitonic and quasi-particle rhythm (carriers are solitons, defect in the order flows in an ordered structure,
the ordered structure is edited to make a loop).
5. Ionic diffusion rhythm (ions are carriers, tube-like
cavities are formed in a circular shape or continuous
path to generate a loop).

6. Molecular chemical rhythm (molecules like proteins, enzymes, etc., are carriers, tube-like cavities
are formed and sensory systems make sure a circular
signaling pathway).
7. Quantum beating (spin is the carrier, wavefunctions
interfere in a squeezed excited photonic, electromagnetic or spin state).
8. The density of states rhythm (orbitals coupling, wave
function modulation, virtual carrier, a virtual continuous loop is made).
9. van der Waal rhythm (atomic thermal vibration is
looped in a spiral pathway).
10. Electromechanical rhythm (classical beating with a
mechanical beating like tuning fork).
11. Quasi-charge rhythm polaron, polariton (topological
fractured band based continuous loops).
12. Mechanical rhythm, sound wave (similarly elastic
pathways to make a circuit of sound waves).
Just imagine, such beautiful patterns are one of 12 different
formations. Their physics is different, application domain and
temporal range are different.

FIGURE 7.7 Twelve types of rhythms found in the brain, 12 layers of dodecanions were considered seeing not just the hardware layers
from top to bottom, but the abundance of 12 key information processing parameters.

Fundamental questions that “connectome-” based brain models cannot answer: Once a generic rhythm-based pathway connects the smallest molecules like DNA and thousands of proteins
to the largest structures like hippocampus in terms of rhythmic
cycles, we get eight parallel worlds instead of one that is a neuron, then, can answer fundamental questions that “connectome-”
based brain models cannot answer (Reimann et al., 2015).

5. How is time represented in the brain? Periodicity of
rhythms at atomic to the centimeter scale is the time
(the brain is a clock inside a clock, at every scale it is
a timekeeper for time crystal).
6. How do the specialized systems of the brain integrate with one another? A system is part of a slower
rhythm, no part at any scale is left alone, hence it
is nested, escape time fractal hardware connected by
time crystal.

1. How is information coded in neural activity? A dead
map cannot answer. As a collection of multiple
rhythms with a common contact point, without using
any fitting we can show geometric encoding.
2. How are memories stored and retrieved? Neuron alone
does not store memory. Stored as integrated cyclic
rhythms at different time scales, the entire cyclic pathway is retrieved if a few points in rhythm are triggered.
3. What does the resting activity in the brain represent?
Reconfiguration of multiple rhythmic cycles into a
singular one, phase transition and automated re-wiring involving all layers.
4. How do brains simulate the future? “Future” is a
rhythm generated by rhythms containing the past
memories, time crystal always simulates the future.

We get answers to all these queries when we build a very simple model of prime numbers for the human brain (Figure 7.8a).
The oversimplified model is a circle, left side is input via sensors that processes primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, it means in
any input sensors find C2, C3, C5, C7, C11, and C13 symmetries. Then, 8 such sensors (octonion sensor tensor) take
input via 31 spinal +12 cranial nervous systems, take it to
midbrain and project to 47 functional domains of the cortex
(Brodmann’s region).
The three distinct regions of Figure 7.8a is isolated in
Figure 7.8b. There are three domains, first, sensor, where time
crystal data is 12D but dynamics encoded for time crystal is
only 4D. It means, in 12 different axes different dynamics are
encoded but four imaginary worlds one inside another hold
the 12D data. The second domain is midbrain where the data

structure is 12D but dynamics is 8D, and finally cortex the
third region where data is 12 D and dynamics are 12D. Below
three columns, three time-domains are explained. As the 12D
data passes through the deeper brain structures, 4D dynamics
converts to 8D and that reaches 12D dynamics. Direct experimental electronic resonance band measurement for DNA,
proteins, microtubules and organic structures, neurons and
their clusters, suggested data for estimating different dynamics while we took EEG and other data for the global scale
measurements. Microhertz resolution resonance frequencies
could be measured without noise trouble. Below microhertz,
large time-domain data was collected and based on the slopes
nano hertz to femto hertz data are produced. Note that nano
to femto hertz is just one band and we had to consider that as
nano-hertz is around 30 years and we need to take into around
120 years as some peoples are alive until then. Triplet of triplet resonance bands are observed every single layer, in each
of the three sub-bands in a single triplet there are eight “fundamental resonance peaks” and numerous other resonance

peaks. Finally, Ghosh et al. have generated the resonance
band of the entire brain. Here are 12 bands of a brain, first
six bands are experimental data measured in Ghosh et al. lab,
the rest six bands are derived from other researcher’s reported
measurements.
Figure 7.8c outlines the major components of the brain
model as demonstrated in Figure 7.8a. The geometry of
spinal and cranial nerves, midbrain 1 and midbrain 2 systems are represented using 2D geometric shapes. Similarly,
2D geometric structure of brain stem, limbic system
(Figure 7.9a), a combined central nervous system, CNS and
peripheral nervous system, PNS (Figure 7.9b) are presented.
Combining the operation of all participating components the
decision-making time crystal for the brain (Figure 7.9c) is
generated. If the phase relation between different components is taken into account, then the 2D structure converts
into a 3D structure, which embeds inside a complex time
crystal structure. To do that, we simply put a phase sphere
around a geometric shape.

7.7.1 Eight Sensors Hold Crossover Magic
of Octonion
The brain operates by tensor algebra as described in the
Chapter 4, but the question is how? Figure 7.9d explains that
simply for a quaternion touch sensor, four different streams
of pulses form a typical time crystal, hence each sensor element is a 12D-4D time crystal, as explained above. When the
time crystal for MC and SG interact, they bond to create a new
time crystal. A similar example is shown for an octonion tensor

that holds information for eight distinct sensors of a mid-brain.
The two diagonals of an octonion tensor represents emotion
and proprioception, i.e., two fundamental senses of a human
brain that regulates its conscious behavior (Figure 7.9e). One
could also notice that in the figure taste information interacts
with smell and as a result vision is affected. Thus, following
this octonion tensor we understand that eight sensory systems
which undergo C2 symmetry by crossover (Figure 7.9f) generate in certain organ in the midbrain but activates certain part of
the higher brain. Thus, tensors that operate and regulate human

200

consciousness physically links surprisingly different organs in
the brain-body system. If hardware grows within and above
such tensor products would govern systems in a very different
manner than the common circuit concept we learned for over a
century.
Wide distribution of synchronization time across the
brain: The human brain has developed a distribution of
convergence-speed across the organ controls, which could be
visualized in the fMRI images, any change in that triggers
folding and restructuring of entire brain structure. For example, say, emotion-processing region converges the fastest
say within 1–2 ms, then, the smell-processing region, say in
~3–10 ms and so on up to 50 ms, say for the visual region.
The most important and abundantly accessible information
reaches convergence in the slowest speed. Thus, it ensures
that while solving a problem, the newly generated time crystals in the slowest region are instantly cross-checked in the
control-region of fast-processing time crystals. As a result, the
possibilities of de-coupling are also alleviated. To implement
the speed control in the hardware, the shape of the region, circuit complexity and size of the storage are taken into account
in the human brain. The degree of randomness in the network
regulates the speed of convergence and size is a dependent
parameter for the above two. Order of preference among particular regions for reaching the convergence of neuron firing
does not mean the human brain is a sequential processor, if
required, even after completion of visual processing it could
re-trigger the emotion-processing. The entire process could
be repeated several times, until all emerged time crystalclusters are transformed.
Hierarchical time crystals causing folding/restructuring
in the forebrain: slower rhythms make system more intelligent and creative: The resting-state fMRI study when
compared operations in the brain between a rhesus monkey
and a human, they found that the front brain and the back
part carries out extensive information processing back-andforth in the resting state for human but not in the monkeys.
During the brain’s decision-making, a synchronous stream
of pulses propagates back and forth, between the frontal
lobe and the back part of the brain where the visual control
is located. The provision is made, using dual transformation
antenna pair, the core information being processed sustains
for a long period of time, ~100–150 ms. Within this time
convergence is reached for all essential parts of the problem, technically, the input-time crystal cluster transforms
physically and logically into an output form. Brain repeats
that for solving a problem for the geometric artificial brain
means, harnessing the time crystal database associations as
extensively as possible, and, then shrinking the possibilities
to a few choices by multi-level synchrony. Therefore, the
first requirement of speed control is to identify and isolate
the key features of the problem as distinct coupled clusters
and then oscillate the entire packet of clusters physically
between the two potential walls like a ball, until the solution
is reached or transformation is completed. In other words,
when transformation antennas are in operation, there is be
a tag, “do not disturb.”

7.7.2 Eight Mathematical Operators Run
Two Orthogonal Math Engines
Figure 7.10 outlines a table with eight operators, top-down
applied sequentially. To explain the mathematical operator,
we represent the human brain using two orthogonal cylinders.
As explained in Figure 7.8b, here sensory data is a dodecanion tensor d4 D , it’s every element a time crystal represented
by quaternion tensor, each element of that quaternion tensor is
information about singularity points. The tensor d4 D comes out
of sensor and while passing back and forth between mid-brain
and left-right crossover, the tensor d4 D converts to d8 D. It means
the data structure remains the same but its elements, which
were earlier quaternions, now becomes octonions. In the third
and the last phase the third feedforward loop runs between 47
Brodmann’s region in cortex and midbrain, the tensor d8 D converts to d12 D. In summary, two cylindrical columns make the
tensor d4 D → d8 D → d12 D . Four feedback loops run in parallel.
One feedback loop builds a time crystal from pulses, second
feedback loop builds first quaternion learning time crystal Lq,
third feedback loop builds octonion learning time crystal in
midbrain and the fourth, feedback loop builds a dodecanion
time crystal Ld in the Brodmann’s cortex region. Eight basic
operators regulate entire operations, first, three tensor building
operators, quaternion, octonion and dodecanion. Then, second
step is crossover (autocorrect operator A). The third step has
two operators, which grows simultaneously, one, pure learning
L4 D → L8 D → L12 D ; the other, memory M 4 D → M 8 D → M12 D .
Finally, geometric algebra (Figure 3.12a) and PPM operators
(Figure 4.12) located in the 47 Brodmann’s region transform
the time crystal.
When the information is extracted as part of memoryretrieval, the typical feature of the pulses is reproduced, just
similarly as tape-recorder repeats the same song every time it
is played. It is a delicate issue when the brain-memory plays
an event, the mechanism is that a few words of the song come
discretely from distinct sensory-organs, and then superimpose with each other as a combined, coupled time crystal
without any conflict. Therefore, the sensory-organs while
constructing their own wave-stream, keeps free space in the
time-grid so that those parts are filled by other sensory organs
when they construct their own wave-stream. Thus, when
wave-streams from different organs come and overlap into a
single multi-level wave stream, all pulses carrying particular
time crystals occupy separate locations. If not, a particular
color-coded in a pulse with particular intensity, pairing and
coupling, could overlap with a particular sound or particular
touch, or taste or smell encoded pulse. Therefore, the attempt
to build a global database of brain’s biological rhythm is the
beginning of unraveling the mysterious pulses observed randomly at different parts of the human brain and frames the
very foundation of the geometric artificial brain.
The sensory input-generated time crystal-cluster of a particular organ (say visual time crystals) could be complementary to others (say sound sensor produced time crystals). Such
complementary, supplementary, and conditional time crystalbased coupling is possible if electronic pulses originating from

FIGURE 7.10 Top left corner table shows eight operators that primarily regulates the brain operation. The bottom right model explains
architectural and operational pathways in the brain. Two orthogonal cylinders represent two parallel information transmission pathways,
with a common crossover. Mathematical operators explained in the table is used here to document the essential mathematical operations
for the decision-making, using four operational cycles. 1. Synthesis of quaternion at the sensors. 2. Crossover and synthesis of octonions.
3. Learning. 4. Expansion and synthesis of dodecanions. The data structure is always 12D; however, 12D time crystals are packed in a 4D,
8D, or 12D tensors that transports and engage different brain components. This is explained using a few rings.

different organs have similar amplitude and follow identical
time-modulation protocols. Since the brain uses pulses of similar shape throughout (all pulses have a spike-shaped irrespective
of their sensory-origin) one could easily couple multiple pulses
to define particular kinds of a time crystal. Similarly, by maintaining similar kinds of phase behavior one could easily tune
decay and growth profiles of pulses, but similar time modulation
protocol is kept universally constant from the sensor to the brain.
The similarity that is the advantage for the brain inhibits us from
unraveling the information encoded by organs in the brain.

7.8 THE BASIC DEVICE FOR DECISIONMAKING IN THE BRAIN
The smallest decision-making device in the brain is helical or
vortex shaped water channels residing inside a molecule, like
protein, DNA, and microtubule. One helical channel cannot

operate by itself, in Chapter 8 we would describe how three
concentric spirals could act as a universal time crystal generator, namely Hinductor, H. We find such structures all over the
brain-body system. Figure 7.11 shows one prime example.
Microtubule, its inner water channel and outer water channels
make a triad, a complete H device. Several such filaments or H
devices come together to form a bundle, as axon core, on that
core, actin-spectrin filaments form a hollow cylinder wrapped
around it, and then oligodendrocytes, astrocytes all connected
cell branches form three layers. We get H2. Finally, several such
H2 devices or neural assemblies form columns (e.g., a cortical
column), these millimeter-wide columns form 2D sheets, the
sheets form different structures for various organs throughout
the brain-body system, listed as H3 in a table in Figure 7.11.

for running the magnetic vortex based time crystal processing, and both electromagnetic and mechanical effects play an
equal role in governing the neuron firing while neuroscience
ignores the electromagnetic part and considers mechanical
ionic movement controls everything in any living cell or neurons (see schematic below Figure 7.11). The squarely parallel
chemical and physical protocol is then implemented in creating an entire time crystal model of the whole brain, we believe
that this step would fundamentally change the way biology is
being studied today. Though existing neuroscience has concretely established the chemical link, electrical wave in cortex
is considered as thoughts (Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001)
it does not explain how self-assembly begins at the atomic
scale and ends up in the meter scale. Therefore, the geometric
electromagnetic interaction model is also an additional framework to provide the missing link. We do not discard existing

neuroscience or biology; we suggest that existing biology
looks at the ionic response and molecular chemical interaction
as an absolute expression. For the PPM-GML-H triad, ionic
and molecular chemical events widely reported in the biological textbooks could be included as the dielectric responses in
the kHz frequency domain. However, some other things happen in MHz that controls the events in kHz domain, then some
other things happen at GHz domain and this journey continues until several peta-hertz frequency domains. Moreover, in
the Hz, milli-Hz, micro-Hz, and nano-Hz processes are also
there. Most biologists are interested only in the kHz imaginary
world if we locate them in the time crystal model, but there
are six similar universes above in the slower time domain and
six similar universes below in the faster time domain; if we
do not include them, a complete mechanistic explanation of a
biological system cannot be done.

203

A Complete, Integrated Time Crystal Model of a Human Brain

The decision-making protocol of the human brain:
In the geometric model, the human brain is neither a classical
nor a quantum computer (just being fractal does not mean
quantum; Gardiner et al., 2010), it operates among 12 imaginary space-time-topology-prime worlds at the same time,
generating a quaternion of self-assembled time crystals following linguistic criterion (who, what, when, and how). A linguistic quaternion is a decision, in the brain it gets filled up
by dodecanion time crystals, but the linguistic core structure
is never compromised. Thus, a human brain solves a problem
continuously, in fact, the massive architecture of time crystals have one-to-one correspondence and these two protocols
perform only one computing in a human life, it begins with
birth and ends with death (one life is ~109 s, it is a stream of
100 pulses of a 10–11 Hz oscillator). There is no reduction
protocol like classical or quantum computing, no deterministic decision for any query, resonance-based projected set
of vibration by the PPM more with holographic engineering.
The human brain therefore is an automatic fractal correlation analysis, storage and retrieval machine, since relative
weights of different time crystals are assigned in the PPM of
time crystals of each brain organ only after the query is made,
therefore, we cannot explain the human brain using a Turing
machine. Since any input signal, visual, voice, taste, smell or
touch senses are taken directly as 3D pattern of pulses carrying 11D geometric structure, eventually converted in terms of
basic geometric patterns like circle, triangles, several kinds of
polygons, close and open U-shapes, etc., by “fractal decomposition,” therefore, we can find some past correlations for
any input fractal, processing does not require a framed logic.
The decision-making in the brain means sensing symmetry of
the time crystals within and outside and creating new crystals
to regenerate symmetry. Thus, computing acts smartly when
due to unknown parameters, the problem is even difficult to
define, the faintly correlated pattern from the PPM of time
crystals is projected as output, thus, we get instant decisions
continuously for a series of inputs where even the problem
is not defined. If we look at the cross-section of an entire
sensory bundle containing a million nerves, it will appear as
a 2D pattern of frequency change as a function of time say
it is Q( f 1, f 2). However, it should strictly be noted that the
very particular geometric relationship of the input image is
not destroyed. The fractal frequency approach can generate the quasi-periodic oscillations in the brain described by
Izhicovich as a direct output of a generic frequency fractal
map.
Learning and spontaneous brain circuit evolution:
The brain uses maximum energy in the central layers, where
the neuron resides. The eventually fused fractal in the hippocampus, which is the solution of the input problem, does
not disappear instantly from the hippocampus after sending its
mirror copy to the cerebellum. It sends the final solution fractal
back to the cortex regions and the process to write the evolved
fused fractal. The majority of the fractal frequencies is found
common between input and the memory; hence they neutralize vibration, however, some neurons vibrate continuously

to meet the requirement of new frequencies. The minimum
frequency difference causes “beating” and the antenna of
the neuron generates “electronic signal burst” which is then
detected by all other neurons in the neighborhood. The stream
of bursts continues until suitable neurons create wiring with
it properly and/or microtubules inside the axon re-wires to
accommodate the new fractal part. “Beating” based modulation principle argues when a set of neurons decides to fire and
why firing occurs at a very selective region of the brain.

7.8.1 H3 Device That the Brain Uses Everywhere
Tension based morphogenesis and compact binding of the
central nervous system (Van Essen, 1997) suggests for a universal decision-making device (Llinás, 1988). Here H3 is the
decision-making device as listed in Figure 7.11 (see Chapters
2 and 8 for H1, H2, and H3). Hippocampus looks like a unique
device, but actually the same cortex layer formed by hexagonal
close packing of cortical columns folds uniquely to build the
hippocampus, limbic system, nucleus, nerve tracts, etc. Thus,
H3 is not a very particular design, it is a theme, on which the
brain has engineered many different structures, the most prominent of them are the cortex layer and hippocampus, one may
say hippocampus is a big cortical column.

7.9 FUSION OF CAVITY AND DIELECTRIC
RESONATOR MODEL OF A HUMAN BRAIN
When a single chain polymer builds a protein molecule the
dynamics show like a teardrop slowly convert into an ellipsoid. Inspired by this dynamics and morphogenesis, all brain
cavities listed above were converted five compositions as
outlined in Figure 7.12a. Using eight basic shapes that transform a teardrop into an ellipsoid, all major brain cavities
could be regenerated by adding certain noise (Figure 7.12b).
Phase synchrony and desynchrony is a key to brain operation (Lachaux et al., 1999). The attributed device for resonant
communication neuron has not just one but many thresholds
(Sardi et al., 2017), which is more extensively studied by
Ghosh et al. (2016). Since forward and backward propagation
of action potential is both presents, neuron cavity is a resonator (Scott, 2007). Clock-like responses of a neuron have hierarchical organization (Strumwasser, 1974). Thenceforth we
created a cavity based on the potential distribution required
to represent a time crystal of our choice. That area was converted into a neuron geometry using an algorithm. As outlined
in Figure 7.12c.
The architecture of spatial symmetry = architecture
of temporal symmetry: Transport means one position to
another, in the time domain, i.e., nested hardware one inside
another does not need to do that. Right from DNA to the
largest brain oscillator, 12 components are there where triplet of triplet resonance bands is observed. We trigger natural vibration of the oscillators for computing; therefore, we
do not require power supply even if we want to resonantly
vibrate entire frequency fractal hardware made of 100 billion

its shape we could regenerate the neuron architecture following the algorithm listed here. (d) Using the PPM the neurons could be selfassembled into cortical columns and 47 Brodmann’s regions using a single algorithm of cavity filling.

neurons. The only reason for energy expenditure is the circuit evolution, changing the neuron orientation, constructing
new synaptic junctions, rejecting old connections, which are
essential to write a new fractal seed in the column of “if-then”
time crystals. Neurons need to be fed, since cells are alive, we
repeat, following the PPM-GML-H triad model, the energy
required for computing is negligible. A system communicating with its constituents is an oxymoron. Thus, we integrate
time crystal, convert 3D geometric shapes for a time crystal
into the available 3D space for the neuron to grow. It was a
major, aggressive decision that architecture of time symmetry
equals the architecture of spatial symmetry. However, from
a cortical column to various neural assemblies listed in 7.11
table could be created. The most exciting part of this study
is that there is only one simple principle, “find skeleton of
a given 3D space” and we could generate the architecture
needed for the time crystal.
What is the information contained in the human brain
model? Resonance state writing is a unique process in the

brain, at different levels, it occurs in a unique way; at protein
level, it is a change in the relative orientation of secondary
structures; at the neuron level, it is selection of microtubules
of different lengths at the neuron level; at the cortical column
or rhythm control level, it is the organization symmetry of the
neurons. Thus, before any information is written the chain of
resonance bands starting from DNA, protein, enzyme, microtubule, neuron to the neuron clusters and ends with the largest oscillator that is the entire brain, therefore, information
is a time crystal. A human brain is a singular time crystal made of an endless network of rhythms (opt to reject
entire hardware and be happy with time crystal to upload
consciousness!!!), it means an argument when it includes
a time function, that also means after a certain time t, it
would change to another time crystal, in this book we use
time crystal in general, always it means a 3D geometry
whose corners are singularity points. To run this cyclic loop,
around a geometric shape, one primary source of energy is
thermal noise, it is already shown that biological clocks are

205

temperature independent (Hastings et al., 1957). Where in the
brain, do we see “spontaneous reply back”? The layered
clock: In the time crystal model every biological system has a
multi-layer vortex or spirals like a signal receiver and a fractal
antenna for the wireless communication and/or “spontaneous
reply back.” A DNA replies back to proteins, enzymes, and
all single molecules. Then, these proteins and small molecules reply back to the supramolecular assemblies created
by them like microtubules. Several such filaments reply back
to the neurons, which replies back to the cortical columns
and it continues to the final assembly, the brain. Singh et al.
have simulated all-dielectric structures of a real human brain
mapped in UCSD (Figure 7.13, a–f). The brain cavities are
considered as a cavity resonator + dielectric resonator + water

resonator (Figure 7.13a), the composition of resonators is like
H devices, three layers build a feedback network which could
create periodic transmission of fields or carriers along with the
system (Figure 7.13b). In connectome (Figure 7.13d), neuron
(Figure 7.13g), in axon core (Figure 7.13h), in blood vessel
(Figure 7.13e), and in ventricles (Figure 7.13f), everywhere the
electric and magnetic field distribution shows a periodic transmission spatially all over the structure. Thus, every single seed
replies back to everybody at every moment, no question is ever
asked, it is collective responsibility for all to regenerate the
lack of symmetry or eliminate the asymmetry following PPM.
if the symmetry of a particular time crystal-cluster is known,
then we do not need to search every time crystal of that cluster, during spontaneous reply the system simply test one and

reject all associated options (symmetry breaking) to speed up
the computing rapidly. Eliminating multiple symmetries is a
difficult task, however, it is shown that simply by adding a constraint, almost all symmetries could be broken (Puget, 1993).
A journey from atomic scale to the largest structure
in the brain: always it’s a hills and crest in a 3D potential surface: When proteins are pumped at electromagnetic
resonance frequencies, the electron density distribution in
the secondary structures (cluster of α helices in tubulin) of
a protein molecule looks like electron density distribution
in a single small molecule. The same pattern evolution is
also observed in the single microtubule, filamentary bundle
of the axon, group of neurons, etc. The potential fluctuations among different seeds (alfa helices in a single protein, tubulin in a single microtubule and microtubules in the
axon bundle) are delocalized among many seeds to generate the collective resonance properties. Say, molecules selfassemble to make a larger seed, then, potentially takes a
different form, which controls the electric, magnetic, and
mechanical resonance (Hughes, 2018), that very potential
should remain distributed among all elemental seeds inside
the bigger seeds, thus, all clocks in the brain are nested,
one such map is shown in Figure 7.14, its 2D representation

is in Figure 7.15. In the cluster of cortical columns the
inter-column potential induction via diffused gradient of
neurotransmitters, the composition of neurotransmitter
river-flows combines multiple cortical columns as a single
integrated unit, just like a single molecule. Several cortical
columns or nucleus regions made of neuron clusters, i.e.,
nucleus, fibers, 47 Brodmann’s regions in the cortex operate as a single molecule like system. Why is there wiring
in the brain? When several such sensory controls located
at far distant places in the brain needs to be integrated and
formed a single molecule like system then neural pathways
hold the potentials for constructive interference of waves in
the larger cavity, just what the atomic bonds do in a single
molecule. Re-wiring and propagation of nerve impulse is
following the changes in mapping the 3D interference patterns in the host functional lobes (sub-seeds). The objective is that the potential distribution corresponding to the
resonance of multiple carriers in multiple time domains is
mapped inside the host cavity that could be a protein complex, cortical column, nucleus or brain stem or the entire
brain does not matter, size changes, so the carriers, thence
the need for various mechanisms. In other words, wiring is
an illusion.

7.10 TIME CRYSTAL MODEL OF
THE HUMAN BRAIN
Popular science claim that the brain is a black hole
(Buonomano, 2017), gets a new dimension in time crystal
map. How a human brain keeps time has been a point of
discussion for a long time (Buhusi and Meck, 2005). Some
researchers have proposed that keeping time is fundamental to its information processing (Wing, 2002). It is not just
that the neurons engage in the management of time (Ivry,
and Spencer, 2004) the basal ganglia, when it learns a new
trick, it builds time crystal architecture (Graybiel, 2005).
The similar kind of time management is found in the cerebellum, whenever it learns coordination in the movement,
it builds an architecture of time slices or clocks (Thach,
1998). The human motor activity has a robust, intrinsic
fractal structure with similar patterns from minutes to
hours (Hu et al., 2013). Thus, the development of the fractal
architecture of the time is abundant in literature varying all
over the brain, yet there was no compilation by biologists to
build a generic musical model of the brain. A time crystal
model of the human brain shown in Figures 7.14 and 7.15
would enable providing the seamless regeneration of the
lost organs (Biasiucci et al., 2018).

GML is inspired by the brain’s intricate engineering
to process music: The hidden language in the brain what
researchers have always been looking into could be in the
form of music (Brown et al., 2006). Not just that brain perceives the music and its evolution pre-attentively (Koelsch
et al., 2002) intersensory connections are also musical,
smell’s neural signature looks like music (Plailly et al., 2007).
Fusing two sensory time crystals in the GMLs are inspired
by this intra-sensory feature of the brain. The brain is hardwired so that it perceives temporal regularity in music (Large
and Palmer, 2002), which is fundamental to the time crystal
analyzer described in Chapter 2. In computer science language, one could state the brain finds a hierarchy of recursive
functions, or nested recursive functions automatically and
elegantly. Brain’s engineering is so intricate that it naturally
differentiates between an absolute pitch and a relative pitch
(Zatorre et al., 1998; Zatorre and Halpern, 2005), which is
again a fundamental feature of a time crystal analyzer.
Magnetic rhythms or clocks in the brain: are they
output of magnetic vortices? Magnetic rhythms in the
brain are known for a long time (Cohen, 1968). Even the
magnetic field of a single axon has been studied (Roth
and Guo, 1988; Roth and Wikswo, 1985). The research of
the biomagnetic field effect on regulating the biological

208

Nanobrain

phenomenon has been very well documented (Barnes and
Greenebaum, 2007). Since microtubule, DNA like a various
magnetic vortex, ionic vortex and electric vortex generators
as a fourth-circuit element (Chapter 8) are abundant in the
brain, we closely reviewed the research work that monitored the magnetic rhythms. Note that to be a Hinductorclass fourth-circuit element, the charge-flux ratio must be
linear and should be seen optically at least during neuron
firing. While axon’s magnetic field was studied long back,
the magnetic study of ionic firing has been demonstrated
recently (Barry et al., 2016). Therefore, magnetic rhythms
or pure magnetic clocks must be abundant at all scales of
information processing in the brain. It is shown that continuous frequency glides in the brain’s neural network
generates cortical magnetic fields (Arlinger et al., 1982).
Neuromagnetic brain rhythms run for minutes for human
cognition (Ramkumar et al., 2012). The reason magnetic
stimulation based functional imaging of the brain works is
manifold (Ilmoniemi et al., 1999).

7.11 FOUR METRICS OF PRIMES
RUN IN PARALLEL—THE SAGA
OF HEXAGONAL LATTICE
The classic use of PPM is observed in the pupil of our eyes.
When discrete time crystals arrive and remain unattended by
one metric, then the hierarchy of metrics attend them (Damsma
and Rijn, 2017). Gamma band activity of the brain reveals several rhythmic tones connected to each other such that we could
represent them as a single metric (Snyder and Large, 2005).
The fractal geometry of the brain (Di Leva, 2016) uses four distinct types of metrics in parallel. Pieces of literature are rich in
claiming that mind-brain paradox holds a fractal solution (King,
1996). The origin of scale-free dynamics in the brain (Eguiluz
et al., 2005) is easily explained by composition of four metrics
(Figure 7.16). In the brain at all scale, components try building
a tiny PPM, tiny means, limiting integers are narrowed. A brain
does not have one but trillions of PPMs, but they integrate and
build more complex ones. However, since the pattern of primes is

Prime engineering in the brain
Brain needs elements vibrating
following symmetries of five
primes only 2,3,5,7, 23 are
enough to deliver the rest of the
primes using them.

FIGURE 7.16 A table shows how 12 primes govern the information processing at four different levels (three primes are left). Four
PPM-1 that regulates the synthesis of 12D time crystal information via sensor cells, PPM-2 that regulates the sensing and synthesis of 4D
linguistic quaternions for the sensory input data (four linguistic queries are who did it? What it did? How it did? At which condition?). Then
comes PPM-3, this metric governs the sensing and synthesis of octonion packing of sensory time crystals and finally PPM-4, that expands
the information content. To the right of the table it is shown that 2, 3, 5, 7, and 23 are enough to create other primes using geometry. To the
bottom, hexagonal lattices are found in the microtubule, cortical column assembly, etc, its different pathways taking 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 elements at a time it is shown that they could replicate 12 + 6×4 + 1=47 clocks, which is exactly the number of Brodmann’s region in the brain.

209

A Complete, Integrated Time Crystal Model of a Human Brain

universal, all PPMs governing functional responses in the brain
deliver a scale-free dynamic (Eguiluz et al., 2005). Biological
clocks are rhythms of life, the clocks running for milliseconds to
seconds (Foster and Kreitzman, 2004); here clocks do not end at
the neuron surface, there is an infinite chain of segmented times,
which forms an infinite, incomplete network of clocks.
Four major PPMs governing the brain are information,
PPM-1; local sensor, PPM-2; global sensor, PPM-3; higherlevel sensor, PPM-4. Each metric processes 12 primes at least
(Figure 7.16), we have listed in the table how typical metrics
corresponding to a typical prime (Figure 3.4) is actually generated in the brain. The statistically dominating geometric shape
in the time crystals is also noted in the metric table. Two points
need to be kept in mind. First, 2, 3, 5, 7, these four primes
could generate all other primes easily, geometrically as we
observed in the brain components, except 23. Unfortunately,
the most important information processing in the neuron layer.
Therefore, we need only five symmetries; the rest of the prime
dynamics could be regenerated from only five symmetries.
Second interesting feature is the importance of hexagonal lattice (see Figure 7.16 bottom). A hexagonal lattice could hold
various kinds of clocks simultaneously, some options are shown
in Figure 7.16. Thus, Brodmann’s 47 regions use hexagonal
carpet to process any possible integers and prime dynamics.

7.11.1 Composition of Four, Eight, and
Twelve Dimension Tensors
Distributed parallel computing in parts of cortex shows tensor
algebra like signal processing (Anastasio and Robinson, 1990).
If tensors are there, theories of a holographic brain projecting
Schrödinger’s wave could not remain far (Nobili, 1985). Clocked
cell cycles clock (Edmunds and Adams, 1981) to process three
distinct classes of tensors simultaneously. All large-scale models
of a human brain (Eliasmith et al., 2012) are linear, 4D, 8D, and
12D network of time crystals is the singular undefined model of
the human brain. Octonion algebra could estimate the phase elements of the tensors interacting with each other (Furey, 2018).
However, dodecanion algebra would loop the interactive elements, once? Twice? In reality, looping isolated elements mean
triggering the PPM. Four-dimensional unified brain theory
(Friston, 2010) is not transformed into a 12-dimensional brain
here, rather, a variable dimension brain that explores the topology of dimensional transformation would be the right explanation of the time crystal brain model discussed here. Imagine
some thoughts are 2-dimensional, some are 8-dimensional, and
some events are 10-dimensional (Figure 7.17), the truth lies
in the pattern of imaginary worlds active among 4, 8, and 12
choices, it is non-computable (Stulf et al., 2015).

It is NOT soluon/expression.

FIGURE 7.17 A table shows the comparisons between the four types of metrics that govern the brain operation. At the bottom, we demonstrate how four PPMs process tensors and deliver a decision for the brain. The brain preserves the linguistic quaternion (who, at what
condition, what, and how) for all 12 primes to deliver an output Q, i.e., the conscious state.

210

As said earlier, information is linguistic (Figure 2.10b),
four imaginary worlds, each shares a clock, they hold the
answer to four queries, who, when, what, and how. The four
PPMs described in Figure 7.17 have identical linguistic
structures; however, the tensors have multiple choices as
described earlier in Figure 4.13. The only point we add here
is that the quaternion composition of four metrics, PPM-1,
PPM-2, PPM-3, and PPM-4 delivers us the conscious
state or the state of mind Q of the human brain in a time
crystal model.

7.11.2 Quaternion, Octonion, and Dodecanion
Biological rhythms and nesting of rhythms were there
always: Now it’s a crystal and composite materials but
made of clocks: It takes five to six days for RNA to replace
a protein molecule; the replacement of cells in the body
follows a very particular rhythm. Skin cells are replaced
in every 14 days, we get new blood in every three months,
we get a new kidney in every 17 months; in 24 months we
get new bones; and in 100 years we get a new heart. Even
our breathing, heartbeat, circadian rhythms run perpetually. One interesting aspect that we would like to introduce
here is that we now look at all these rhythms from relative
changes of one with respect to another. For example, every
three months when we get new blood, skins have been
replaced roughly six times. The frequency of skin cycle Fs
is six times more than the frequency of blood cycle Fb, we
can write Fs = 6Fb. In this way, all cycles would be related.
Not only this is true for the cell replacement cycle, for circadian and other rhythms, but we can also find that there are
rhythms inside a rhythm. Not just biology, nested rhythm
requires new math and physics. Self-organization goes on at
all scales at all time. Biological rhythms are distinctly different from the decision-making rhythms, which are primarily
ionic, molecular, chemical. Figure 7.17 primarily concerns
decision-making rhythms which are physical, electric, magnetic, mechanical, etc.
Graph theoretical analysis which was used connect
structure and function (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009), now a
composition of the quaternion, octonion, and dodecanion, i.e., tensor of 4, 8, and 12 imaginary worlds took over
(Figure 7.17). Critical and limiting features of the brain are
often discussed (Beggs and Timme, 2012), possibly, the
limit of all limits is set by the tensor triad of 4, 8, and 12
imaginary worlds. Temporal coding enables segmenting
the event scenes in the brain for all kinds of sensors (Engel
et al., 1991). In the second step isolated or segmented events
are temporally bonded by the typical tensorial bonding protocols (wilder than quantum: hand interacts with eyebrow
to sense rose smell; Engel and Singer, 2001). It’s a top-down
synchronization to implement quaternion, octonion, and
the dodecanion (Engel et al., 2001). All the tensor elements
are phase lags that estimate the singularity or undefined
domain when two clocks interact (Ermentrout and Kopell
et al., 1994).

7.12 TIME CRYSTAL MADE MEANDER
FLOWER TO A GARDEN OF GARDENS
Musical rhythms have been reported from all over the brainbody architecture, for example the cerebral substrates (Halpern,
2006). Thoughts are often attributed to cerebral rhythms
(Steriade et al., 1990a). Different parts of the brain respond
to musical emotions very differently, especially in the frontal
brain EEG one could read musical emotions distinctly (Schmidt
and Trainor, 2001). Even during motor learning music like
rhythms are born (Sakai et al., 2004). The brain states are
oscillatory and if information in the brain is considered as
geometric, then, using neural oscillations it becomes easy to
explain the brain states (Nie et al., 2014). The map of temporal
disorders suggests that a set of clocks or a local part of time
crystal could move from one system to another and build a
new system (Rensing et al., 1987). This particular mechanism
is the foundation of brain’s decision-making, the brain has
a storage of complex time crystal system (first two columns
of Figure 7.18), from these running banks, the brain picks
tiny little clusters of clocks or local time crystals and builds
unprecedented time crystal as thoughts (last three columns of
Figure 7.18).
Garden of gardens (GOG) pick flowers from different gardens of time crystals, synchronize those flowers as petals to
build new flowers (Glass, 2001), the transition from clocks
to chaos to clocks continue (Glass and Mackey, 1988). PPM
governs how and which petals to be picked and to be brought
together. The journey of time crystals that begins as a singular clock, ends in a random collection of flowers in a garden, which ends in the formation of a conscious architecture,
GOG. A GOG attains the ability of build new flowers since
it’s a composition of 12 life like gardens of time crystals, so
each of its garden has 12 distinct classes of time crystal systems. GOG is composite life form made of 12 life like systems. Unconscious means an absence of garden of gardens, by
delinking of 12 garden-integration systems; yet all 12 gardens
remain active (Goila and Pawar, 2009), the inverse event is
therefore the construct of a conscious machine. Large-scale
synchronization like a world wide web is a good metaphor
(Varela et al., 2001), but it reveals nothing about the intricate
nature of clocks.

7.12.1 Twelve Dodecanion and Eight Octonions
Build 20 Conscious Human Expressions
In the 1880s, B.W. Betts developed a mathematical system for modeling the development of human consciousness
through geometry (Cook, 1887). How brain builds its cognitive codes is the hallmark of the science of consciousness
(Grossberg, 1980), now, with the advent of a fractal tape, an
entirely new scientific exploration is getting a shape around
it (Ghosh et al., 2014a). Geometric information estimates the
neural interactions in the human brain (Nie et al., 2014), often
the interactions are considered to be electric (Nuñez, 1998).
However, linear layered architectures of intelligence like deep

learning are often thought of as a recipe that would never
match biological intelligence (Nikolić, 2017). Brain oscillations could be read as biomarkers in neuropsychiatric disorders (Yener and Basar, 2012), biological rhythms should reset
medical treatment (Halberg, 1977; Hildebrandt, et al., 1957),
a shock of phase singularity could assist in medical treatment
(Richter, 1960); phase reset curve that identifies a time crystal
could act as diagnostic tool (Tass, 1999), i.e., time crystal as
a biomarker (Yener and Basar, 2012); rhythm-medicine connections are studied for a long time (Reinberg and Smolensky,

1983; Schwan, 1957). For example, the mitotic cell rhythms
in cancer show a typical behavior, that could be used as a
marker (Sainz and Halberg, 1966). Figures 7.19 through 7.21
outline garden of gardens created by following Figure 7.18
fusion of time crystals produced by different brain components. We describe below the consciousness generating time
crystals, which should generate in an artificial brain naturally
in the prime symmetry designed oscillators.

A Complete, Integrated Time Crystal Model of a Human Brain

clocks are geometrically reorganized (Chennu et al., 2014).
Coma is a state where certain higher-level integration clocks
get shut off, several PPMs and time crystals run in an isolated
manner (Plum and Posner, 1980). The rhythm of breathing
edits the rhythms of the limbic system and that change affects
the cognition of a human mind (Zelano et al., 2016).
D2: Memory: However, the dream to crystallize a memory (Ramirez, 2018) for uploading consciousness would
require a complete time crystal model of the entire brain
with all basic conscious features. While uploading the resetting the human clock (Winfree, 1991) would require editing
the garden of gardens, i.e., hierarchical architecture of conscious clocks. One could state that keeping time could be
a singular function of a human brain (Miller, 2000). When
dust deposits on the strings of musical instrument, the clock
slows down. Similarly molecular clocks undergo epigenetic
changes, the clock architectures running conscious experiences (Figure 7.21) shows the sign of aging, i.e., clock
diameters shrink or expand (Mittedorf, 2016). Twenty automated conscious experiences that run via 20, time crystals
are running simultaneously, perpetually for entire life range
­milliseconds to seconds (Näätänen et al., 2004). These are
the building blocks of the human brain (Nowakowski, 2018)
path toward true neurogenesis (Gage, 2002; Konishi, 1990;
Kuffler and Nichols, 1977). Memorizing anything requires
high-frequency signal transfer (Kucewicz et al., 2014), shorter
clocks of the time crystals build specific pathways. Memories
follow prime 7 while grouping events (Lisman and Idiart,
1995). Memories make synapses strong, is it making information stable or circuit (Lisman, 1997), else one builds false
memories (Loftus, 1997).
D3: Language: Probabilistic theories fail to explain the
large-scale replication when a human comprehends a language (Nieuwland et al., 2018). Grammar is a delicate feature;
its time crystal model has been described in detail following
the transmission pathways for the nerve spikes in real-time.
It resembles reservoir computing but many clocks work in
parallel (Hinaut and Dominey, 2013). Mind and language are
intimately connected by meaning and experience (Follesdal,
1975); only that was not known how the mind looks like
(Sudkamp, 2006). General-purpose learning of language is
fundamental to the brain’s development (Phillip Hamrick
et al., 2018). Using simply the temporal difference one could
comprehend speech (Shannon et al., 1995). Any human language has embedded clock-like rhythms (Schwartz et al.,
2003; Langner, 1992), auditory signals have music like temporal architecture (Cariani, 1999; Zatorre and Halpern, 2005)
so it naturally processes musical scales (Elvira et al., 2006).
D5: Universal time: The sense of time of a life long journey defines human cognition (Levin and Zakay, 1989), voluntary timing intimately relate brain function, the architecture of
time undergoes a subtle change (Wing, 2002; Winfree, 1970).
Timelessness emerges when time crystal bridges singularity
(Winfree, 1973, 1986a), wherein the pattern of phase compromises (Winfree, 1974, 1986b). Biological clocks set time for
perception of events (Moore-Ede et al., 1982), but those clocks

217

are not isolated. Time travel inside our mind evolves the brain
(Suddendorf and Corballis, 1997).
D6: Fear, threat, anger, hate: Every single thought,
imagination, dream, fear, love and joy are geometric structures now (Cook, 1887). Only second to millisecond time
domain is presented here but could be extended much deeper
inside the brain. Hallucinations in the brain are composite,
derived time crystal originating in the Paracingulate sulcus
morphology (Garrison, 2015), one could edit that geometry
in various ways. Paranormal activities in the brain tell a similar temporal structure (Radford, 2010). Social and ecological drivers have regulated the brain size evolution of various
species (Forero and Gardner, 2018). Brain-to-brain coupling
follows certain rules to create and evolve social structure
(Hasson et al., 2012).
D8: Mimicry, skill: Mimicry is one of the finest expressions of a conscious being, its cognitive circuits were explored
(Hale and Hamilton, 2016); emotion is exchanged between
two conscious beings through mimicry, it is grounded on
a concrete geometric feature of the periodic information
exchange (Prochazkova and Kret, 2017). Playing music in
the brain requires programming skills as a series of periodic
tasks. Its limiting features are decoded in the geometry of
temporal architecture of music and skills together (Hart et al.,
1998). The brain detects musical pitch naturally (Meddis and
O’Mard, 1997).
D10: Personality: Personality and mind are dichotomies
of conscious experience (Lowen and Miike, 1982). Perception
is neither discrete nor continuous in a time crystal structure, it
is both (VanRullen and Koch, 2003).
D11: Love and Pain: Depression is topological, it spreads
fractally repeating the same geometry (Shibata and Bures,
1974). Deep brain stimulation is often attributed to cure (Hall
and Carter, 2011), such random rhythms are like hitting a
stone in the dark, time crystal map of a human brain could let
us editing a target clock from outside.
D12: Learning: Learning is conditional editing of temporal architecture (Howard et al., 2005) namely “temporal
context” (Howard and Kahana, 2002). Prime number 7 is
important as it sets the limiting number of learning variables
(Miller, 1956).
D12: Dreaming: The time crystal for sleep might generate
very slow clocks in the brain stem, not part of the components
that run formal sleep time crystal (Merica and Fortune, 2000).
Sleep has a slow traveling wave (Massimini et al., 2004).
Sleep spindles are like local structures in a global time crystal
for sleep, regulates slow rhythms (Ueda et al., 2001).
O1: Fusion of primary sensing: Self-organizing dynamics that define thoughts in the brain follow critical geometric features (Kelso and Fuchs, 1995) to integrate all kinds of
information (Konorski, 1967); time crystal language enables
that universal fusion.
O3: Attention: Neural correlates of attention have long
argued for a connection of clocks (Reynolds and Desimone,
1999). Just prior to attention the mind is musical (Koelsch
et al., 2002).

218

O7: Emotion: We consider bias is bad, but to converge
and directional learning we need bias (Mitchell, 1980).
Humans are emotional machines, programming it to reasoning is moral policing (Hume, 2000).
O8: Synthesis of time: Biological systems govern time by
defining time (Goodwin, 1967) using phase shifts as key elements of architecture (Goodwin and Cohen, 1969). In the current
brain model, time is not just fundamental to the brain structure
but to the universe, such a discussion is out there for a long time

(Girelli et al., 2009). Time was considered a scalar quantity in
memory (Gibbon et al., 1984); however, now it’s a vector quantity in the form of a tensor (Libet, 2004). Transcranial magnetic
therapy could retrieve a memory (Rose, 2016). Remembering and
consolidation of memory follow a unique pathway (Sara, 2000),
often brain scans memory at very high speed (Sternberg, 1966).
When neurons arrange more orderly, it’s a better memory (Xue
et al., 2010). Neuron defines its time (Ivry and Spencer, 2004) so
is the brain (Miller, 2000).

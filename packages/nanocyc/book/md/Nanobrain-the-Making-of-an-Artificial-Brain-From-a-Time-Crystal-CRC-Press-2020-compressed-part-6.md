(GOG)—Universal Time Crystal
5.1 GÖDEL’S INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM
AND THE FRACTAL TAPE
The grand old photon: We know that a photon keeps time by
traveling with the velocity of light. When a photon comes to
our eyes from a distant galaxy, for that photon there is no time
lapse in the travel. It touches the surface of the star and our retina cells and everything in the universe at the same time. Since
the time of the Big Bang, the universe might have expanded for
our frame of reference but for a photon it has remained static.
The photon still lives in the time of the Big Bang. The concept
of time lapse starts when we come out of a photon’s frame.
To describe several events occurring simultaneously, we are
forced to state each step, one after another, just because our
machine reads only one bit at a time. The architecture of time
or time crystal is a many fold temporal correlation between
any two bits of information; time moves in many directions.
Now, “loss in parallelism” due to sequentialization needs to
be avoided, but managing the flow of time with phases at
many layers is not an easy task. A single time crystal can have
many system points at a time. The pairing of only two events
by completely neglecting the possibility of coupling three or
more events is an unrecoverable weakness that affects through
the complete destruction of higher-level logic in a Turing tape
system. Since a time crystal does not forcefully linearize a
one-to-many and many-to-one network, it captures “simultaneity.” In conventional computing science, we strictly confine
ourselves within the concept of pairs, two elements interact
at a time. The concept of higher-level logic encompassing a

group of arguments links all contributing elements at a time.
Then we do not have to pinpoint accurately where, exactly,
our desired information is located.
The singularity dilemma: Imagine we have a technology
to slow down or speed up photons so that we can control the
flow of time (Panarella, 1987). Suppose now we are solving
a math problem for a natural process that is slow, we speed
up the computing time and get the solution faster. Standard
computing problems are shown to truly benefit by manipulating time, e.g., via satisfiability (Schnorr, 1978), by checking
the isomorphism in trivalent graphs (Galil et al., 1987); by
generating the parallel hierarchies (Bloch, 1997); possibly by
tuning an infinite time Turing machine (Hamkins and Lewis,
2000); etc. Close time like curve are loops where the system
point returns to the same space-time location after a closed
motion. In such loops, all pixels on the perimeter coexist at a
time, it is naturally engineered to squeeze or expand time flow
by changing its diameter (Van Stokum, 1937). It can solve
hard problems (Brun, 2008) and bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing (Watrous and Aaronson, 2009).
One very exciting thing about the quantum clock is its direction of time. Can we set it, and if we do, would it remain
as a quantum clock? Where defining the length of a path is
not legitimate, the perimeter of a closed-loop would coexist
in many paths at a time (Abbott and Wise, 1981), the most
reported quantum clocks use a hidden classical certainty, just
like a quantum logic gate. Thenceforth, Reddy et al. have proposed a new kind of clock, whose pixels in the perimeter are
also clocks, so, as we zoom the pixel, we go deeper and deeper

117

into an endless chain of clocks. It is neither classical nor quantum. In standard time series of signals, a self-similar pattern is
searched (Kantelhardt, 2011; Shlesinger, 1988) and termed as
a fractal clock. In contrast, the shortest time of a fractal clock
is a circle, if zoomed, it is a clock too, so, a piece of time anywhere in the network remains undefined, we get singularity
everywhere. Since singularity is undefined, tons of differential
equations are not useful at all, so does a fractal clock, consequently, we encounter a singularity dilemma.
When Darwin drives Gödel’s incompleteness: Both
truth and false does not exist: Turing’s world of computing and Darwin’s theory of evolution are two concepts that
are apparently unrelated, but, stems from a similar fundamental ground “matter holds its complete properties” and
binary true/false argument. Historically, both the philosophies have undergone multiple eclipses and reincarnation
of Turing and we look beyond the completeness philosophy and binary arguments, where the logical statements
are composed of multiple truths. Hence there is nothing
as the truth and nothing as the false, to hold and process
a matrix of truths with analog values, we need “symmetry + energy” duality, then, no arguments are isolated,
everything is interconnected just like a many-body system. It leads to the philosophy of information fractal,—
very different from the fractal holographic universe and
other fractal models of the human brain and that of the
universe. Information fractal means we do not care how
the hardware looks like its resonance band is a fractal, also
we emphasize on escape time fractal not the iterative function system. Here, due to escape time fractal tape network,
a point carries infinite numbers of scales inside, but just
by reading it one cannot explain the entire universe. Phase
prime metric (PPM); geometric musical language (GML);
and fourth-circuit element, Hinductor or H-based triangular computation has one argument, one energy packet, one
Turing like tape, one clock, one rhythm, one oscillator that
encompasses the entire universe, but if we enter inside, we
find millions of that inside, the journey continues forever to
the Plank scale. The zoom-journey inherits a fractal culture,
but there is no absolute self-­similarity at any scale, since
primes do not repeat.
Gödel’s incompleteness theorem: First theorem: Say we
have a bag of arguments, now by combining all these arguments in all possible ways, we can generate several axioms,
none of them would be new as outlined in the Figure 5.1a.
Axiom means a primary theorem. To create truly any new
axiom, we have to bring some arguments from outside the
bag, if we don’t bring new arguments from outside the bag, the
newly produced argument is already there. Starting set of arguments is always incomplete to create anything new, if we bring
anything from outside, that again changes the bag we start with.
Second Theorem: If we have an axiom that includes all arguments inside the bag and some arguments that were brought
from outside to make it new, then the axiom is incomplete.
Quin’s what there is, Plato’s beard, Bertrand Russell’s
Theory of Descriptions (RTD), and Wyman’s “unactualized possible”: Plato’s beard suggests that if we state

Nanobrain

something does not exist, the statement is itself a piece of evidence for its existence. By Quine’s argument (Quine, 1980)
Plato’s beard argument does not hold good because no claim
is made in the statement that it does not exist. The positive argument is an argument, the negative argument is not.
Wyman adds that a statement that something does not exist
means it cannot be found in reality as a spatio-temporal
entity. Russel’s theory of descriptions considers a statement
as a point object and links it to all that could build a connection and then all that are not linked. That way, RTD splits
a statement into three parts, “that,” “everything,” and “nothing.”
For PPM-GML-H triad (Phase prime metric-Geometric
musical language-Hinductor), we find a set of symmetries
associated with it, philosophically it means association with
universal similarities of primes. Thus, triangular split suggested by RTD is applicable here with a twist “that” evolves
as a composition of “everything” and “nothing” in the PPM.
Two entities “everything” and “nothing” are “geometric
shape” and “phase space,” respectively, in the GML. Two
entities are realized in the fourth-circuit element, Hinductor
(H) as “knots of darkness” and “vortex of light.” Together,
the triad covers a tiny part of an infinite time domain of the
universe (Figure 5.1b).
Evaluation of PPM with respect to the butterfly effect,
chaotic and random or deterministic features: Chaotic
system is absolutely predictable if we know the initial condition this is called the butterfly effect. Now, one can theoretically calculate the future of the system. But for us even
if we do not know the initial condition, rather a part of the
entire system, we can still get it. Like the weather, we cannot predict more than a few days because input conditions
do change. But we can have a situation when we should be
able to resolve this issue also. We are neither “chaotic (if
known input, then tell output),” “random (even if we know
the input, cannot predict)” nor “deterministic,” it is “quasideterministic,” always reaching toward determinism, but
being an asymptotic function, determinism is never reached,
like a fractal tape (Figure 5.1c). The same run would give
different result in two consecutive runs, like a classic random system.
Self-referential systems with time as primordial category following Peirce: Thus far no attempts were made to
build a technology that is a self-referential system. The biggest hurdle was the criterion that the system would deduce
the axioms by itself and then it would be so original that
for any deduction, it would only refer to itself. The demand
is like, “we cannot find the Shangri-La in the Himalayas,
unless we know where it is.” PPM is theoretically the system that can deduce the axioms using geometric musical
language, GML. Now, true processing of the PPM–GML
system is possible only if we use the fourth-circuit element,
Hinductor (H), and build hardware that reflects PPM. Thus,
PPM-GML-H triangular system is a self-referential system.
The time crystal architecture and the electromagnetic resonance band feed each other (Figure 5.1d). In this system,
time is a primordial category free of any form of interaction
from outside. Peirce suggested that this happens if closed

loops are made of singularity points, which does not accept
data or noise from outside (Peirce, 1940). Growth of PPM
is primordial to every single entity, from the smallest elementary particles to be found around the Plank length and
plank time several millennia from now to the extreme end
of the universe, the growth is not natural but metrical, or
we could state, as natural as metrical. Growth in the maximum integer of PPM in hardware is also a growth in the
time crystal (Figure 5.1e).
From Heisenberg to Gödel via Chaitin: Both
Heisenberg and Gödel set the limits and Chaitin connected
that to our brain. Heisenberg said, if the time is short, we
cannot understand the energy exchange accurately, while
Gödel suggested that a consistent formal system that has
just crossed the threshold size of doing simple arithmetic is
incomplete. Since our brain is an infinite network of clocks
operating one inside another, its energy exchange is undefined at all scales. Moreover, since it is also proved that a

hierarchical topology is possible to create a system with a
few primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, it means the geometric
mathematics regulates such a system. Even a tubulin protein-based microtubule nanowire is an incomplete system.
Now, Chaitin has put a philosophical argument (Delahaye,
1989), if a finite set of degrees of freedom is given, can we
create an indefinite number of outputs from that. In fact,
PPM is attached to finite degrees of freedom, it could generate an infinite number of time crystals using a fractal
tape (Figure 5.2a). Chaitin’s query that argues for establishing that a brain is more than a computer has a unique
solution in the PPM perspective. Just like several critical
NP-complete problems could be solved by conditioning it
(an ant can solve a traveling salesman problem), similarly,
here brain=an assembly of finite degrees of freedom is a
sufficient condition to trigger the nesting of clocks following the PPM. All objects reside in mind and no object exists
apart from the mind (Berkeley, 1959).

5.1.1 A Marriage between Frequency Fractal
Hardware and the Time Crystal
The eclipse of Newtonian thoughts in the 1960s: The days
of scientific certainties were over in the 1960s, Newtonian
clock-like universe concept turned out to be an illusion,
with more and more examples coming up from nature, like
the motion of clouds, the behavior of a flock of birds, etc.
The unpredictability is definitely hardware. One of the fundamental requirements of hardware is a feedback of the
same system and ability to generate superimposed output,
individually looked into the system would provide the same
bigger picture. It is not visible in the larger scale simply
because the smaller part is cut off by the resolution we set,
but how the self-similarity could be encoded as a generic

tool, so that anybody could program more and more selfsimilar patterns are not discovered yet. However, several
such patterns have been found starting from Mandelbrot,
Z = Z 2 + C, how this equation which is called God’s own
fingerprint interacts between two sides of equality as feedback is the most exciting part of an engineer who wishes to
device and engine like God.
“nature, at some extremely microscopic scale, operates
exactly like discrete computer logic.” “So I have often made
a hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the machinery will be
revealed, and the laws will turn out to be simple, like the
checkerboard with all its apparent complexities.”
Feynman (1967)
The Character of Physical Law.

The hypothesis is further developed by Wolfram, Fredkin,
Finkelstein, Minsky, Wheeler, Vichniac, and Margolus.
The discovery of a new kind of linguistic sensor: We
build a sensor that rejects the use of Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and generates time crystal from every single information. Here event = [subject-clause-(verb-adjective)] means, we
search for event = [Slowest/static/supreme host-Condition/
Key/Initiator-(What is done-how it is done/Fastest)]. We use a
device, fourth-circuit element, Hinductor, H; which is a helix
made of insulators that stores the charge to tweak the interference of reflected electromagnetic signal from its surface into
a dynamic geometric shape made of the null signal, which
acts like free magnetic particles. Conventional electronics
follow current-voltage characteristics. Newly invented fourthcircuit element H does not exhibit any current-voltage characteristics, but, magnetic flux-charge characteristics. Lack of
electron flow forces us not to call electronics, instead of real,
what flows is a virtual particle. Since no signal is found in
the free particle-like dynamic structures, so, it is said darkly.
Such knots of darkness (E = 0 in the interfered electromagnetic wave), are not static, behave as free magnetic particles.
Using GML if one could map the active and the inactive
regions in the 3D spatial structure of interference patterns,
or temporal evolution of the free particles, it retrieves a time
crystal. We add two additional helical layers, one below
and one above to perturb and generate nested clocks like an
event = [subject-clause-(verb-adjective)].
Sahu et al. (2013a, 2013b) have shown that proteins,
microtubules and several organic and inorganic structures
generate the resonance bands, strictly associated with a time
crystal where the symmetry of primes is explicitly evident.
We derived the required geometric parameters of a helix or
vortex to mimicking microtubule or cortical column or neural
network in the brain and body. The objective was to replace all
12 brain components, that we studied accurately from human
brain model with a circuit made of generic fourth-circuit
element Hinductor that would be a universal time crystal
generator as required by GML for fusion, extrapolation,
reduction, transformation and morphogenesis of geometric
shapes by PPM. Thus, by generating the knots of darkness
or magnetic particles as a function of charge, we could build
nested clocks that follow event = [subject-clause-(verbadjective)], we realize the fourth-circuit element, Hinductor.
One could physically emulate the role of primes or singularity
points in a practical device, i.e., a 3D assembly of Hinductor.
The marriage between Hinductor and PPM is analogous to the
marriage between a Turing tape and a transistor.

reflectance (S11) and transmittance (S21) and determine the
spectrum of ac frequencies at which the values are maximum.
Now, if the molecule has multiple embedded symmetries then
for each symmetry, we do expect a new distinct frequency that
makes it transparent. Several times, multiple peaks appear,
shift, get active or silent together, as a result we could build a
time crystal architecture. Does the brain involve in wireless
communication across the entire architecture, is it quantum or classical? The answer is no. A brain does not have a
giant antenna-like structure there is no high-powered radiation, transmission. In fact, even if we make the provision for
massive power radiation, it will be completely absorbed in the
immediate vicinity. The concept of resonance chain suggests
that there is a common overlap among the resonance bands
among all components that makes the brain jelly or the entire
brain architecture. The process ensures band to band transition of energy just like that happens when we add one electron to a molecule, all atoms distribute a part of the electron
among themselves.

5.1.2 PPM Allows Two Systems to Sync
without Communication

In classical digital and quantum computing, if we want to
find an answer to a question from 16 different persons, an
algorithm needs to be written by a software engineer, wiring
is necessary to connect components, and the question needs
to be asked and processed one by one in classical computing
or as a group in quantum computing (Figure 5.2b). In brain
jelly computing the question is asked out loud for all to hear
and the person with the right answer replies back (spontaneous reply-back). Also, it signifies that we do not have any

What is an electromagnetic resonance: Do we promote
the idea of electromagnetic resonance alone in this book?
Electromagnetic resonance means that if we pump an ac signal, the molecule transmits the ac signal at a particular value,
using conventional network analyzer or impedance analyzer one could measure these dielectric properties namely

5.2 THE ORIGIN OF FRACTAL
RESOLUTION AND INSTANT REPLY
Scale-free dynamics is an essential outcome of Fractal
tape network: It is established for the human brain that logarithm of frequency varies linearly with the logarithm of power
expense in the brain. A logarithm is an important mathematical tool that tells us that the order of variation is important in
a system, not a linear step-by-step increment. In other words,
the parameters would take values 1, 10, 100, 10000, 100000
and the hardware is architectured in such a way that it considers the non-linear increment as the linear variation of 1,
2, 3, 4. The situation originates from a simple design protocol, “one unit communicates with 10 others at every level,” or
“one-to-many and many-to-one at a time, at every level.” One
very interesting aspect of this eight-level operation would be
that “time to synchronization” or “computing speed” would
be the same for all levels of operations, the larger sizes would
require fewer complete wave patterns to synchronize; while,
the smaller size clusters made of only a few neurons would
require significantly large number of waveforms. Eventually,
both the processes would finish synchronization at the same
time. It is the “clock inside a clock inside a clock” feature that
originates from a Fractal tape network in Chapter 2.

wiring to address the switches one by one, which represents
a radical shift from the existing world of computing.
Living life is resolving an intractable problem perpetually:
Real-world problems are all similar to some classes of intractable problems for which we need solutions at every moment.
It could be shown very easily. Suppose, we are passing through
the road which is crowdy, we analyze completely different
dynamics of every movement and determine the minimum
collision paths. It is a traveling salesman problem. But if the
path makes a pattern, and we need to detect the path, it would
be a Clique problem (Figure 5.2c). When we are arranging
books in a bookshelf which has different kinds of boxes and
we have different sizes of books, this is famous “bin packing” intractable problem. If a number of shelves are less than
50, with computers we can do but if it is more then we can’t,
but a geometric artificial brain can do. Satisfiability: one kind
of problem we often solve at every moment. Like taking a
decision where a set of three arguments are compared with
a set of 5 more arguments while 3 more arguments are valid
at the same time. It is also an intractable problem and we do
it always. Knapsack problem: while sharing biscuits to kids,
we optimize often solving this intractable problem. Finally,
Clique problem, identifying a typical pattern in a complex pattern is unique pattern recognition that we solve every moment.
The solution of the majority of the intractable problems
is associated with constructing the linking between two
or more distinct time crystal-clusters. Thus, irrespective
of the nature of the intractable problem, the solution is a
path connecting several time crystals. Unlike predecessors,
the problem is dealt with a pattern of primes, i.e., PPM.
The better algorithm means “clever rejection of choices”
by minimizing search tasks. PPM uses clock inside a clock
inside a clock network, a geometry that runs in the time
domain of slower clocks could perform the same task in
the faster time domain and solve it (Figure 5.2d). Computer
scientists argue that the actual difficulty with the intractable
problems is finding the accurate answer, with approximation “intractable” is never a problem. However, here PPM
does not approximate solution, the system spontaneously
replies back the solution, the system point of the computer
does not have to search. For example, in a Clique problem
that we target in the PPM computing, wherein, a small 3D
pattern is identified in a complex 3D network of patterns,
the similar pattern can resonate with the given input pattern
as both are encoded in a set of oscillators. It is just like taking a magnet and finding a pin in the pile of the haystack,
i.e., search without searching.
Therefore, here PPM has no agenda of bypassing the complexity using hidden approximation protocols. Since several
true paths are spontaneously created beforehand and stored
in the hardware, or created during computation, automated
clustering of time crystals is encoded in the oscillators as
a cyclic rhythm since a brain-jelly holds a wide number of
problems. Resources increase with faster clocks (Figure 5.2e).
Therefore, if we consider isolated single time crystals as
rhythms then we have a basic layer of time crystals, at the bottom, then, considering the coupling of a few time crystals, we

Nanobrain

get another layer just above the bottom level, say, this is the
level two. Several of these small-time crystal-clusters couples
to form another set of groups, whom we could assign to level
three (Figure 5.2f). In this way, several layers of time crystal
clusters are formed already during the learning process, much
before we attempt to solve a problem. During the search process even if a small part of the already existing path is triggered, however, due to the natural property of synchrony, the
entire path gets activated.

5.2.2 Automated Error Correction through Time
Crystal Learning
Singularity is not a single point; this is an undefined region. If
two clocks with similar embedded time crystals synchronize,
their corner points could match anywhere in their common
time domain. Thus, the sum of the area of singularity domain
is the error correction done by time crystals (Figure 5.2c).
In the conventional self-assembly, bonds are made between
participating materials, here, either A inserts inside a singularity point of B, or B inserts inside a singularity point of A.
Thus, the possibility of error is negligible.

5.2.3 Synchronization of Time Crystals
and Incomplete Problems
P or NP, that is the question: Is the debate unnecessary?
Is the question tweaking words of the English language?
Now, we have passed debating more than a century, “do we
need more paper? (intractable, P or NP? P = polynomial,
NP = non-polynomial).” If any person can prove P equals
NP or it will never be equal then they can get 1 million USD.
It is the first time, if we decide “yes,” we are the winner, if
we say “no” again, we are the winner (Figure 5.3a). Why it
is not solved, simply because if we do not know how many
more papers are needed (undecidable) then we cannot tell
confidently NP could be converted to P or not. If anyone
knows how many papers are required to complete the statement then NP = P. From the research of the last hundred
years we know that P = NP is several cases (Figure 5.3b).
But could there be a mathematical world where P = NP is
never true?
If Russel’s paradox sets in then we reach a world where P
never equals to NP and if it does not, then NP would always
be converted into P. Russel’s blockade is like many body
theorems in physics and we already exist in such a world.
Therefore, we have a situation P never equals NP. Then why
do we see some cases where P = NP? Those are illusions of
nature, we view several fractal arrangements of papers side by
side, so it appears as if it is a series of papers glued one after
another just as the Turing suggested. Very soon we will argue
below that this is never the case. Well, it is a game for the
kid, make some sentence that forces us to collect more papers
then we are incomplete (Gödel’s incompleteness theorem),
and if we write a statement so that how many more papers of
arguments we need we don’t know, we keep it as a variable,

then it is undecidable. It is as simple as this (Figure 5.3c). So,
completeness or incompleteness, decidable or undecidable are
issues on the necessity of the papers while Russel’s paradox
is all about cutting a paper into multiple pieces. One example:
Bipartite matrix has non-entangled “separable state” subset
and entangled state subset, while multi-partite matrix has an
additional “partially separable” subset, now, whether mixed
states are separable or not, this is itself an NP-hard problem.
Synchronization in a nested clock network of a clock inside
clock inside a clock… ensures an exponential increase in
sync time, because the PPM-GML-H triad acquires geometry in any time domain, syncs or desyncs them in the fastest
time scale and finally brings results back in the desired time
domain (Figure 5.3d and e).

5.2.4 Umbrella of Perception—Harvesting
Infinity and Projecting from Infinity
If there is no classical point-like qubit, how does reality come from? Fractal information theory (FIT) considers that “there is a Turing tape inside every single cell of a
Turing tape,” this new tape now fails to become a Turing
tape. Fractal word is very misleading, since self-similarity
is in the PPM (Figure 3.4). Time crystals that spread over
multiple imaginary worlds could reside on the cells of a
fractal tape. So, the new fractal tape uses a basic information processing unit, a quaternion time crystal connected to each other, a quaternion that represents Turing
tape inside a cell. So, we get a projected hyperspace from

124

the three imaginary worlds, namely “reality sphere” that
sphere is the only real thing in the information units time
loop architecture. In Chapter 8, we describe that typically
designed spirals and vortices generate a 12-hole phase
sphere (Figures 8.4i, j and 8.6) that project the reality
sphere, which is the real term in a quaternion, octonion
and dodecanion. As explained in GML, a time loop has frequencies at certain time gaps to write the geometric shapes,
that is the information content and all the three loops are
imaginary, does not come from infinity but from the imaginary space. The projection is feedback like an umbrella
that takes a pure geometric composition of the present to
the future and takes it back (Figure 5.3f). The path that
enables it to happen is a resonance chain, that a link of
vibrations in the frequency domain (Figure 5.3g). Let’s discuss the philosophy of infinity.
Gabriel’s paradox: Gabriel suggested a trumpet that looks
like a cone but it goes thinner and thinner to infinity, it has
an infinite surface area, but when we try to paint it, we would
require only a finite amount of paint, drop it from its mouth
and it would pass through all the way. One-to-one correspondence between the Gabriel’s paradox and renormalization:
One-to-one correspondence between Gabriel’s paradox and
nested time cycle synchronization that is designed to replace
renormalization, the surface area of the cone is infinity, however, when we put paint to color it, the paint passes through the
tunnel and it blocks at the point depending on the density of
the paint. The paint for us is the observer’s nested time cycle.
The resolution of the solution is always the ultimate.
Hilbert’s infinite hotel: Hilbert suggested a hotel with an
infinite number of rooms. The infinite number of guests could
come in, yet there would always be a room available in the
hotel. The same event could be represented by a circle, we can
take out an infinite number of points from the perimeter of
a circle, yet there would be no disjoint in a circle. A circle is
finite only when we fix an area.
Dart on a dartboard: Suppose we have a pin, we throw
it on the wall wherein a circle is drawn. What is the probability of touching a particular point, given that there is an infinite number of points in that area? If the probability is zero,
then, the total probability of hitting the entire circle anywhere
is zero, but that cannot happen. We need to consider a very
small area, to get out of infinity paradox.
How many numbers between 0 and infinity,
Cantor diagonalization: The answer is infinity, that so
many numbers are there in between 0 and 1, even 0 and
0.00000000000000000000000001. Now, take any gap
between any two rational numbers, we get an infinite number
of numbers between them. {n} = {n2 } = … = {nn }
Hyper-Webster is a hypothetical dictionary of infinite
space of all possible letters. The idea is the same as numbers,
it has 26 chapters of one letter each. Then each of these chapters has 23 paragraphs and so on. Now, if we go on dividing
the possibilities are infinite. The exciting part begins now,
suppose the first chapter of the dictionary has all possible
words beginning with A, then if one removes A, the rest is
same as all possible chapters with all possible words. In fact

Nanobrain

all 23 volumes are self-complete, if we print one of 23, we
are done. One-to-one correspondence between the Hyperwebster dictionary and the generation of multiple spheres:
If there are a large number of observers, of course there are an
infinitely large number of observers, therefore a large number
of “reality spheres” will be produced and those would merge
just like the Hyper-Websters dictionary. All these spheres
are distinctly producing, yet they create a singular identity.
Imagine thousands of “reality spheres” being produced and
all of them simultaneously hold the solution.
Banach-Tarski paradox: It is very interesting now. We
create the same dictionary on a sphere. One could write infinite words on the surface in the infinitely available paths
on the spherical surface. Even if we start walking from any
one point we could travel covering every single point on the
spherical surface following, Up, Down, Right, Left, UR,
RL, UL and DR. Now, if the lattice on the sphere could be
a hexagonal or rectangular, with six and eight neighbors
respectively, we could have three and four equivalent roads
respectively. There would always be two poles and hence,
two identical spheres could be created just from one sphere if
we decide to walk on the routes following a given protocol.
Whenever there is a case of the real number of points, by
Banach-Tarski argument one could create 1 = 1 + 1, when the
number of points is infinite. It violates the proof of Bertrand
Russell. One-to-one correspondence between the BanachTarski paradox and the measurement in an FIT: Suppose
we have a nested time cycle sphere, or a time crystal, the
observer would also be a sphere, it would sync with the paths
and generate the connected path and form a “reality sphere”
just like the one here. Creation of an identical information
replica is its greatness because the solution of a problem is
an infinite space.
Apollonius fractal world: On the sphere we can start
another journey. Either on the disc surface alone with three
circles like the one below, or start with four spheres making a sphere Apollony fractal. In 3D one starts with four
spheres each at the vertices of a tetrahedron. An outer imaginary sphere is the boundary cavity that encloses the four
spheres. The gaps are filled by subsequent Soddy spheres
thus forming a solid object (at infinity). The result is often
called an Apollonian sphere packing. The fractal dimension
of the 3D Apollonian has been calculated as 2.473946 [M.
Borkovec, W. De Paris, and R. Peikert]. Kravchenko
Alexei and Mekhontsev Dmitriy have found an attractor
that creates the Apollony fractal. It is the union of three
functions: f 1( z ) = f ( z ); f 2( z ) = 0.5 ( −1+ si ) / f ( z ); f 3( z ) = 0.5
(−1−si)/f(z); where z is complex, s = sqrt ( 3 ), and
f ( z ) = 3 / ( 1+ s − z ) − (1+ s ) / ( 2 + s ) .
Kissing 12 times is enough to send a message, I love
you: The largest number of unit circles which can touch a
given unit circle is six. For spheres, the maximum number is
12. Newton considered this question long before proof was
published in 1874. The maximum number of hyperspheres
that can touch another in n dimensions is the so-called kissing number. It is shown that optimality for sphere packing is
n = 4. The history of packing problem is here. One could have

Big Data in the Garden of Gardens (GOG)—Universal Time Crystal

fun by packing a given area with circles here, here in GML
one uses spheres to cover a 3D space. There are three imaginary worlds that construct the fundamental unit of information for the geometric brain’s information structure. We see
above that the three imaginary functions if they are different then they make an imaginary sphere. Though the circle
grows with three imaginary worlds, in the Appolony fractal,
the sphere grows optimally with four spheres. For an external
observer, a sphere always looks like as if it is made of three
circles. Thus, the apparent mismatch between the infinity
spheres and circles are resolved.
Harnessing infinity in the sphere and modeling the
human brain: A rapid continuous change in the brain’s
physical structure makes brain modeling a fatal task.
Oversimplification is something PPM-GML-H triad wants
to avoid. For example, conformal mapping of the brain is
done on a sphere (Hurdal et al., 1999). The idea is similar
to those who want to map the brain in a hypothetical structure, but a prime driven brain does not. The FIT suggests
assembling the time cycles on the sphere. Compared to
Hurdal suggested conformal flattening (Figure 5.3h) a brain
of primes do not change the physical shape of any part of
the brain, for the theory, any change in the structure means
a change in the information content. We are bound to keep
its purity intact, and then integrate tiny pieces of information in it. Above we have discussed that a single sphere holds
an infinite number of paths and we could make a singular
mathematical structure of the sphere inside representing the
entire human brain. Each of the circle with an independent
center could represent the time cycle network representing
various organs and their biological rhythms. Using such a
sphere is beautiful because we get only one unified system
to hold infinite possible time cycles. That is a highly generous statement.

5.3.1 Image Processing and Sound
Analysis Using a Time Crystal
Fusion and fission of frequency fractals: Mathematically
synchronization means, several iterative fractal seeds, i.e.,
basic geometric shapes that undergo hierarchical integration
(Figure 5.5c) get fussed. De-synchronization means several
such seeds get disconnected. In the fractal theory three types
of fusion and fission of fractal seeds have been developed.
Type I: Suppose we are looking at a tree, then, the entire
tree could be made of a square and a rectangle put together
as a seed of the fractal and then by copying this geometric
shape several times and then by rotating and connecting with
it in very different ways, we can reproduce the entire tree. By
combining and rotating basic structures, open and close versions of a triangle, square to all polygons including a circle or
curve, or straight line, every single structure found in nature
could be created.
Type II: From a basic straight line all primary structures
like a triangle, square, any type of polygons could be created
using a simple fractal relationship. Therefore, the elementary
filters for a complex pattern need not be created specially and
stored separately in the hardware, a generic frequency fractal
generates all possible polygons from a straight line to circle,
and all patterns co-exist. Any modification to this fractal
stores the nested rhythms in the form of new fractals and again
all possible patterns of those newly stored fractals co-exist.
Co-existence physically means a change in the F and G
co-ordinates of the 2D frequency pattern to create a superposition of all images, just like several traveling paths of electrons
around the nucleus generates a diffused orbital perception.

5.3 REPLACING FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM
BY TIME CRYSTAL TRANSFORM
The culture of harvesting time crystal from a stream of signals is far more advanced than the culture of reading signals
as Fast Fourier Transform (Figure 5.4). When time crystal
sends a signal out, it builds new wave streams for each system point in the time crystal architecture. Not just that, each
stream contains a sequence of waveforms of a very different nature. In the Fourier analysis we look at the frequency
peaks. The peaks are not related. In an architecture of clocks,
the relative phase differences between the system points are
related, the patterns created by a large number of simultaneously propagating waves reveal the projected topology
of a time crystal. Figure 5.5a shows three cases of a triplet
of clocks. First, three clocks are nested one inside another.
Second, the three clocks are one top of another. The third
clock is one connected to the outer boundary of another. One
could notice that even if the relative diameters change, the
output would be significantly different. The three different
classes of nesting of time crystals coexist in a real scenario
(Figure 5.5b).

FIGURE 5.4 Input information is not processed by Fast Fourier
Transform, rather, time crystal transform. These two processes are
fundamentally different. The difference between the two processes
is listed here in the table.

geometry, in some cases it is collection of geometries at various layers one above another that undergoes change. (d) Real-time sound data
looks very different when you say the three words, “flowers are beautiful.” Using an arrow, the words are filtered and isolated. The corresponding time crystals are shown to its right. (e) Image processing is shown by which an image is converted into a set of clocks.

Type III: Several type-I fractals when evolving with time
in the 2D frequency space, at the high-frequency layer where
we can see the evolution of the frequency fractal A in a large
number of pixels, the entire pattern might appear as if it is a
simple straight line or curve. Now, at this situation, if another
fractal B evolves similarly in the same frequency space with
typical common points so that A and B together appears as if
a single circle or rectangle, then type II fractal may be born.
If AB fractal is born which starts evolving together at all frequency space with AB as their seed, we might get the birth
of a new thought that never existed earlier. Similarly, several
groups in multiple different regions of the same hardware
might spontaneously get coupled just like AB, due to similarities in the dynamic evolution then a higher-level perception
fractal is born. These two types of fractals are called type III
fractal.
We have discussed two examples. One for sound and
the other for visuals, how time crystals are born and hold
a nested geometry is shown in the Figure 5.5d and e.
In Figure 5.5d, “flowers are beautiful” is said in three different ways, still, the time crystals are identical. Thus, the

time crystal language has an inherent universality. Another
example of universal information processing by the GML
is spontaneously splitting the cartoon elerat, elephant + rat
(Figure 5.5e).

5.4 TEN SITUATIONS WHEN THE
TURING MACHINE FAILS BUT
FRACTAL MACHINES HOLD ON
Turing machine is universal in principle, it emulates only that
human emulates, it is now listed what computers cannot do
(Hubert, 1972). The 99.99% coverage of all symmetries by
a PPM is not complete, but better than corrupting the nature
with human bias. Fractal machines are predicted to outperform Turing machines (Dubois and Resconi, 1994). Here in
this book we explore the possibilities of ­hyper-recursive-ness,
hyper-incursive-ness, which existing fractal tapes never
explored. These big words simply mean nesting of periodicity
in multiple imaginary layers. Nesting would endorse the very
popular proposals of the fractal holographic brain (Dubois,
1992). Some say there is communication in the quantum

127

Big Data in the Garden of Gardens (GOG)—Universal Time Crystal

entanglement some says not, some measures even the time
required by a quantum state to change (Pfeifer, 1993). We
summarize here, how Ghosh et al.’s fractal tape (2014a) could
never be emulated by existing Turing tapes, be it classical or
quantum.
First, when one converts a set of ratios of the arms of
geometric shapes, into a set of geometries using the PPM;
a particular pattern repeats (Figure 4.14). This pattern is
not the accurate description of the evolving pattern, but
a similarity that cannot be described using an algorithm.
It is a perception. Imagine a triangle repeats infinite times

Why Turing machine fails

over the PPM. But, its corner points always have a different
geometry, so, there is no rule (Figure 5.6a).
Second, fractal tape machine, FTM follows e − π − φ
dynamics, it means electric, magnetic and mechanical resonances follow a particular spiral dynamic. FTM database
does not deal with bits or facts, it deals with singularity or
confusions. A user finds many confusions, either put them
together, or enters inside each one of them and the journey
continues, until the user finds facts. Thus, for a single problem,
a user would create a few distinct architectures of confusions,
whose branches end with facts. Each of this architecture has a

FIGURE 5.6 Ten panels schematically explain why Turing tape cannot simulate a fractal tape that operates based on a PPM. (a) A set

and build a new fused metric, that would set the grammar to evolve symmetries as a function of input variables N. (h) Compositions of
multinions ranging from 2 × 2, 4 × 4, 8 × 8 to 12 × 12 matrices have diagonals, each tensor has two orthogonal diagonal drivers, using
red lines one extreme real and one extreme imaginary world made drivers are shown. (i) Singularity is undefined, but its boundaries have

distinct PPM and to bond them we put all in a spiral depending on the nature of clocks. This, is again an intractable problem (Figure 5.6b).
Third, in this book we discuss only 12 imaginary worlds
operating together, so in the fractal tape, one could enter
inside a cell 11 times. The processing of interaction between
different imaginary worlds is done with a dodecanion matrix.
Now, dodecanion matrix builds a manifold, using a paper
and glue, multiple such manifolds are created (Figure 4.13).
When a manifold is created, knots are written as signatures.
These signatures change due to the interaction of the imaginary worlds. Thus, the morphogenesis of dodecanion metric continues without making any changes in the real world
(Figure 5.6c).
Fourth, there is a special kind of PPM, where an ordered
factor is greater than the corresponding integer (Figure 3.7).
The intricate patterns created on the metric surface never repeats
and so fundamentally different than using a common geometric
shape we cannot reduce it fractally (Figure 5.6d).
Fifth, the clocking directions do not stabilize, stabilization of a 3D architecture of clocks is temporary. Multiple
conditions exist to rotate one clock in opposite directions
(Figure 5.6e).
Sixth, Meander flower garden explains a time crystal
architecture based self-operating machine (Figure 2.7c–e).
Several clocks in a time crystal architecture go silent, for various topological constraints. When it happens, a flower changes
from one form to another. When it happens, that particular
symmetry is restricted in a system, then, the flowers or distinct time crystals of a meander flower garden undergo major
changes. Such morphogenesis of machine is not possible to
carry out in a Turing machine, since it happens in the phase
space constraints.
Seventh, depending on which numbers are silent in the
PPM, the pattern, changes (Figure 3.4). As said, when one tries
to solve a practical problem, he finds where the confusion lies
and ask quaternion questions (Figure 2.10b) continuously until
the architecture of singularity or the architecture of confusion
is built. However, each architecture evolves using their distinct
metric, since the integers present therein change the metric.
Now, when all confusion based metrics are put together into
one architecture, there is a fusion of metrics and a new metric
is born, that then drives decision-making (Figure 5.6g).
Eighth, if one looks at the tensor diagonal elements
for quaternion, octonion and dodecanion (Figure 4.13),
they are identical and unique. Note that in a fractal tape
machine, FTM, the real world is not fixed, it could be anyone, when the observer sees a world that becomes a reality
for it. At a time three observers could see three different worlds; those worlds are reality or diagonal elements
for them. Thus, multiple diagonal drivers redefine reality
(Figure 5.6h).
Ninth, singularity points are the corners of a geometric shape. Singularity in mathematics is a confusion in the
decision-making process of fractal tape computing. The 3D
architecture of confusion, is the geometry embedded in the
time crystal. Note that entire architecture is a singularity

Nanobrain

point. A user starts searching for a solution from a singularity
point or conceptually a confusion and go inside. Each singularity point has a 3D geometric shape which projects distinct
information 360° (Figure 5.6i).
Tenth, two chains of tensor elements could exchange
energy and information if they have a common geometric element (Figure 5.6j), such a condition is impossible to
meet.

5.5 THE HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE
OF AN ARTIFICIAL BRAIN
Figure 5.7 is a summary that outlines a proposed fractal tape
machine-based architecture for decision-making. The chart is
self-explanatory and we outline the speed of computing, that
requires an additional explanation.
What that could never be achieved by increasing the
speed incredibly: When a hundred pieces of time crystals
interact at a time, no sequential set of events could describe it,
or could convert the events in an algorithm format. Therefore,
one-to-many at a time interaction is something that could
never be achieved by speeding up, and this is what makes any
simultaneity based computing model like PPM-GML-H triad
unique and far-advanced that the parallel computing.
Majority of computational algorithms developed in the
last three decades have considered that the devices that hold
the optional solutions of a query could listen to the question
but could not reply-back to the questioner simultaneously and
spontaneously. Thus, to learn the location for addressing each
option specifically, the wiring of computing elements became
necessary in the computer chips.
The circuit is a liability even in a quantum computer:
The associative matrix. Additionally, we need a program
that coordinates the process for a system point to reach to
the individuals and retrieve the replies one by one, several protocols are adopted to decrease the computing time.
The quantum protocol only decreases the number of queries, with Log2n advantage over classical, n is the size of
the search space, but “reply back” requires an antenna and
receiver attached to the memory elements and new kind
of the identification code. Grover’s algorithm suggests
that due to entanglement any number of people in a group
could be considered as one object/choice, if any classical
route allows such group-test such that classical computing
would match the quantum computing. Additionally, except
for a few problems (factorization), the quantum protocol
does not provide sufficient speedup. The reason for the
exponential speedup is the sharing of associative matrix
D, which requires a particular requirement in the nature
of the problem. Moreover, for pattern search, the matrix
D needs to be redefined for each network mode, hence
entanglement needs to be broken, which would collapse the
speedup. There will be no difference between a classical
and a quantum search. The exponential speedup is not the
prerogative of quantum entanglement; it could be realized
in a purely classical system too (Jozsa and Linden, 2003).
“Spontaneous reply back” supersedes the exponential

speedup promised by a quantum computer, associative
matrix D is replaced by locally matched time crystals in a
globally time crystal network.
Instead of Log2n attempts, we want to make only one query,
and the solution would reach the questioner, then the size of a
search space becomes irrelevant. If we use a multinary switch
(with more than two decisions) that has an antenna for each
state in addition to the sensor, it can radiate out the solution
in all directions, so irrespective of n, the questioner gets the
answer in one attempt. Bandyopadhyay and Acharya (2008)
have demonstrated this technology. Fundamentally, the basic
information processing device will be an oscillator attached
to an antenna and a receiver, the oscillator is so designed that
we can write/erase multiple resonance states. When an electromagnetic signal is applied to the device, multiple resonant
oscillator circuits absorb energies specific to the resonance
frequencies and start oscillating. The oscillation turns the system unstable; as a result, the energy is radiated outside via
non-radiative coupling, noise does not mix with signals as
the absorption occurs only for signals with the perfect matching frequencies, at the same time, the emission is always
quantized.

5.6 THERMAL BREATHING BY MICROTUBULE
AND ARTIFICIAL BRAIN
The energy applied to produce, process and store time crystal
is in the ultra-low energy domain, the devices harness available energy kT ( k = Boltzmann’s constant, T = temperature )
in its environment in the kinetic energy of the surrounding
gas or liquid molecules. The energy is transferred by a nonradiative process, therefore, there is no loss during transport,
between different parts of the hardware, the processing and
storage of information is done at the same place, therefore
there is no time loss for retrieving data for processing at the
same time, we save a large amount of energy. Information
storage is done via rhythms of natural vibrations therefore
like the silicon computers, refreshing the switches for every
millisecond, is not required. Also, as we have described, a
majority of nano sized biomaterials have absorption band in
the THz regime (5–6 THz means around room temperature),
hence those are not efficient machines at all, they consume
huge amount of energy from thermal noise or available energy
kT , we calculate only the calorie that we consume, this is
not fair. Entire processing in the artificial brain takes place

130

using the fluctuation of Brownian motion using typical architecture, and/or chemical energy. The computer accepts energy
from outside whenever an instruction is required to operate,
otherwise it does not use any energy from an external source.
Energy is spent through symmetry-transitions and that is governed by speed limits at various scales. Importantly, from the
thermal breathing model, if nature only optimizes the speed
limits while constructing a system, symmetries are born, and
energy is spent only to evolve circuits, it is translated to different simultaneously communicating channels.
Figure 5.8a describes the thermal breathing pathway,
where, defects in the ordered lattice transmits through the
structure as soliton and several solitons of similar nature
and that of different kinds condense. Geometric processing
means a change in the shape of a triangle stored by a time
crystal by noise, until triangle changes into a different shape,
the information content remains intact. Thermal breathing is
made of two simultaneously operating engines as shown in

(a)

(c)

Figure 5.8b. Each class of solitons has its own distinct feedback pathways by which they filter out noise and transmit
signal. Note that each path has a distinct structural symmetry
and an associated dynamic (Figure 5.8c). Sahu et al. (2013a,
2013b) carried out temperature variation of a single microtubule conductivity in the temperature range of 5–300 K.
Figure 5.8d shows that the conductivity does not change with
the increasing temperature. However, if one zooms the nearly
linear variation of conductivity, it shows quantized jumps
randomly, yet it maintains the linearity. Another interesting
feature is that if one encodes a particular conducting state,
then during temperature variation, microtubule holds that
state. It means microtubule has broken valence and conduction band, i.e., the edge states are not straight, rather curved
and makes contact at various symmetries. As a result when
those particular symmetries of microtubule are activated,
then, microtubule transmits through particular contacts
between the valence and the conduction band (Figure 5.8e).

However, such unique energy management using dual channels is surprising. If there exists any unique and new physics
it should exist everywhere, we select brain, since it is compact and its complexity is enormous, an ideal test system to
verify rhythms of the spiral symmetries, because the entire
universe would also be a spiral symmetry,—singing a song
toward completeness.

5.7 LOTUS IN THE PRIMES—REVISITING
THERMODYNAMICS OF GEOMETRY
Why entropy and probability came in the information theory:
what if there is no communication?
“Information is the resolution of uncertainty,” said
Shannon. Quantifying information is dealt with information theory. When we copy and paste a file, it is a lossless
communication, but mp3 coding is communication with a
loss. We do both in our day-to-day operations. Shannon
argued information as a purely quantitative measure of a
communicating entity. Say, through a tube, we are sending
water, now if it is purely random, then there is no effective
communication, but if we pump the water, then it moves in a
certain direction, but how much water can flow? It depends
on how many water molecules we could send in a certain direction. That means from the degree of disordered
motions, we are trying to get an ordered behavior. Thus,
relate probability and entropy.
The origin of the concept “bits,” entropy and channel
capacity: Classical information theory, adds all the probability factors to understand the total information, say we have
tossed a coin, then, P = p1logp1 + p2logp2 =1, so we call it
“bits,” means one bit of information, and entropy is log P, that
is zero. What is the significance of zero? It means the information is transmitted with absolute certainty. Just by saying this
we also make sure that the channel passes 1 bit that means in
a full capacity, since we have considered all possible choices
for tossing a coin, no one can send more information because
that does not exist. For the same reason, 1 bit is the minimum
bit that is required to send that event through a channel. Or a
minimum number of bits required to encode a message without a loss. A basic example of entropy calculation is shown in
Figure 5.9a. On a surface with the monolayer of molecules,
one has to calculate the number of ordered arrangements, and
then, take logarithm, the resultant value is entropy.
Shannon’s information channel capacity is not like a water
pipe: Here, we deal with an events internal probabilistic
structure, not a real channels physical parameter. Hence, it
is always decided in the emergence of an event. More is the
restriction, or ordering or redundancy,
Fractal Information Theory (FIT): A new way of treating
information entropy:
1. Data compression: Encoding always meant finding repetition or redundancy, and then removing
them, thus decreasing the P-value. Data shrinking
always means finding redundancy. In the FIT we do

131

the same, but with a twist, we do not try to find the
redundancy in the physical appearance or an isolated discrete property. We find a natural language
of vibrations that is fundamental to nature. Based
on that universal language we deconstruct the object
and its environment, integrate them in the same language of the time loop and then we also integrate the
observer. Then we create an event seed, not the fractal seed of geometric shapes. Even seeds may create a geometric fractal seed, that’s not our concern.
Thus, change in entropy is not so formal in FIT.
2. Shannon’s source coding theorem, data compression:
“A lossless data compression scheme cannot compress
messages to have, on average, more than one bit of
Shannon information per bit of an encoded message.”
Entropy is a lower limit of lossless data transmission.
3. Huffman coding (1952), data compression: It checks
the frequency of occurrence of a particular choice
and then assigns a length of memory for passing
through channels or processing. It is just like Morse
coding; the most frequent choices are assigned a
shorter length memory space. Using this route, we
can reduce the length of a book drastically compared
to assigning equal length memory using each letter as 8-bit memory string. In an FIT, vibrations of
the entire book are composed in just one geometric
shape, just one, then we go inside the corners of the
geometric shape and we get some more geometric
shapes. In this way the journey continues, until we
reach the singular letter, or fact, but the information
is not a resolution of uncertainty. Arithmetic coding
is better than Huffman coding.
4. Gödel’s incompleteness theorem: If we have a pot
then if we want to explain everything kept inside
the pot, using the materials within, we cannot. We
would need some reference from outside. We need
bigger and bigger circles reaching us to infinity.
Using the number system theory, we can suggest that
incompleteness theory is not complete. Mysticism,
religiousness associated with Gödel’s incompleteness theorem must be uprooted and thrown out.
5. Escher’s paradoxical truth and Huxley’s perennial
philosophy: We can only get a paradoxical truth.
In the PPM, where a different selection of integers
creates a new kind of metric (some examples are
shown in Figure 3.4). For each of the 12 primes we
observed the creation of 37 planes covering 360° in
the Figure 3.2c. Each PPM created by a particular
architecture of singularity is represented by a particular entropy symmetry plot, if we combine all, we
get 3D rotation of all the planes (Figure 5.9a).
Why do we need a new kind of entropy-symmetry plot?
The same information is now classified and at any given point
of time different classes of information have several distinct
features attached to them which are evolving in their own
way. We encounter a similar situation whenever we concern

ourselves with the multilayered time crystal architecture.
The entropy symmetry expression should be plotted in a
new way, one may consider the triangle formed by the linear
entropy symmetry plot for a particular time crystal network
as an object and rotate it by 360° keeping the zero point as
fixed to the ground. The circle created on the ground due to
this rotation represents infinite numbers of layers of the cellular automaton or time crystal architecture, and all linear
plots of entropy-symmetry constitute a conical surface. In the
quaternion, octonion, and dodecanion tensors of Figure 4.13,
one could calculate similarity index and similarity phase as
described in Figure 5.9a, using that geometric phase variation
one could write a generalized petal equation for the universal
entropy-symmetry plot (Figure 5.9b). If the number of petals
in flower increases beyond length, the entropy symmetry plot
converts into a cone (Figure 5.9c).
The entropy-symmetry plot for PPM computer is a conical funnel that changes with time: If we put a marble on this
conical surface, it moves and fixes to a place, if we consider
this marble as the system point, then it moves through different layers and fixes to a particular point of entropy-symmetry
located in a particular floor or layer. It is a very important

functional feature of nano brain architecture. Note that as we
move to higher layers, the number of cells that constitute the
cellular automaton grid decreases, as a result, system point or
the marble, carry out a remarkable task of selecting the level
intelligence associated with the decision-making of the brain.
It is a feature that cannot be realized using normal computational principles, for the reason that higher-level information processing has never been defined in terms of specifically
defined parameters. The concept of multilayered cellular
automaton and its associated molecular architecture together
suggest a new kind of processing where computation is done
in a hyperplane constituted by the continuously evolving pattern of symmetries, in sharp contrast to the classical, quantum, or un-conventional computing the information is never
addressed directly.
We often wonder why do we need even to know how
the universe got created, where is the end of this universe,
if there is any. Even when we are studying what happens to
the nanoscale system, it appears nonsense why should we
learn what happens in a black hole. Limits of a universe can
change every single “faith” we have about science. Even simple assumptions that we make could fundamentally redefine

Big Data in the Garden of Gardens (GOG)—Universal Time Crystal

everything. One could generate several worlds of sciences by
simply changing the basic assumptions, which we think has
no impact on millions of concepts that we regularly encounter.
For example, if we think universe has no upper or lower limits, i.e. it is not a closed system, then “conservation of energy,”
won’t work and if we can create the world full of science considering that universe has fixed amount of mass and energy.
We must give it a try, how the science would look like if we
consider the worldview that the universe is an open system.
A nice proposal is that the universe is a fusion of Escape time
and Iterative Function System type fractals, where everything
is undefined, universe is an architecture of singularity. And
then second option to try would be if the universe is a leaking
fractal cavity resonator, everything leaks.
What would happen to Lorentz covariance if we reject
space, take only time? Lorentz covariance tells us that it
means that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers
that are moving with respect to one another with a uniform
velocity. Motion through space has been the prime concern
for the physicists thus far. For us, when we argue to reject
“space” from “space-time,” keep “time” alone as the singular
variable parameter, we also create a version of Lorentz covariance for such a system. That said, it would mean, “the laws
of physics would remain the same, when the system point of
the observer would match with that of the nested cycle network under measurement.”
Information entropy and symmetry: Researchers have
studied the dynamic and static information entropy using a
ternary molecular switch. The dynamic information exchange
is studied in a 1D well showed the closed box features while
gaseous diffusion of a dimer, trimer, tetramer on a gold surface showed a typical conical symmetry beyond the classical
logarithmic relationship. A general relation between symmetry and entropy is developed for a higher level logic showed the
possibility of divisions and creation of a sectional curvature
on the symmetry surface. Starting from Shannon’s entropy
(1948) we have re-visited the debate on Gibb’s paradox, in the
perspective of the multilevel static and dynamic information
exchange process. Furthermore, the universal relationship
has also been verified in the organic monolayer consisting
of ternary molecular switches. In summery the journey from
binary to multilevel information exchange is reviewed in the
light of the theoretical development has been made in the last
half a century.
Information is a certainty, which is negative of uncertainty;
uncertainty is entropy (energetic transformation), therefore
entropy measures the lack of information of a system. Here
information is a number ranging from 0 to 3 on a surface.
In order to reach maximum entropy on a surface all molecules
would randomly switch to attain a single logic state at equilibrium. Initially when each molecule is at separate positions
with different logic states then they are distinguishable, the
surface contains a large amount of information, symmetry is
low. However, in later stages when most of the molecules have
already switched to the same state then they are indistinguishable, information content decreases, symmetry is high. On a
surface if we observe the evolution of information with time,

133

then the entropy asks whether the candidates have the same
state or not, therefore the entropy is apparently insensitive to
the level of information, i.e. binary and the ternary system
would respond similarly. Therefore, we simply count the number of distinct symmetry circuits on the monolayer and take
the logarithm of that to get the information content in terms
of Nats.
In case of a dimer, trimer, tetramer, considering Lin’s evaluation to the Pauling’s argument to be valid, we checked the
time evolution of symmetry at 77 K on a gold (111) surface.
Initially a set of information is given to the set of molecules
and the surface is scanned at 0.6 V bias using an STM to
check the exchange of logical information thenceforth the
matrix. The interesting point between two time frames is
that the number of molecules is the same; distribution on the
surface is changed to reach an energetic equilibrium. Two
isolated quinone molecule of the different charge brought
together forming unique dimers of incredible natural features
like oscillating in a well periodically, rotating around each
other like a binary star, jumping to intelligent positions, etc.
When they form a global network of molecules these features reflect in a unique way. Functional groups of quinone
were tuned to find tricks to encode rules inside a molecule that
might induce an incredible global transport of information
essential for realizing a bio-processor or a parallel computer.
The regular structure of CA allows assembly through molecular self-organization, and direct accurate measure of entropy
or information contained in it. The small sizes of molecules
combined with their availability in Avogadro-scale numbers
promise a huge computational power, in which the massive parallelism inherent in CA can be effectively exploited.
The distributed nature of CA has prompted comparisons with
neural architecture based computers, one could estimate the
entropy of a brain from the fMRI images during different
kinds of activities, however, that cannot be related with the
computation process. Thus, we feel that in the artificial brain,
it will be possible to correlate entropy and information accurately, unlike the brain.
Thermodynamics of lotus: How the lotus unfolds and
sings the music of cognition (E8 symmetry): Binary switches
(0, 1) when replaced by a higher k level molecular switches
(0, 1, 2, … k−1) in a quasi-closed system, depending on the
number of stable phase or absolute similarity possible, different entropy-symmetry relationship is generated. It generates
a 3D surface if k increases, and converges to an analog multi
logic system when k → ∞, the surface thermodynamically
connects Neumann’s computer to the conceptual machine
like the central nervous system. Direct experimental evidence
for an obvious relationship between information and thermodynamic entropy shows the non-existence of ~100-years-old
mystery and myth associated with entropy. The experimental
verification of the lotus pattern resembles the E8 symmetry
of Lie Algebra. Recently lotus symmetry that encompasses
the golden ratio (1.61) has been demonstrated experimentally
suggesting that the magnetic resonance frequencies occur as
ratios of golden number in the spectrum (Coldea et al., 2010).
The E8 group squeezes all states—and local operators—into

134

representations of the group. And they’re quite big. There are
not too many singlets (one-dimensional representation that
never transforms). The fundamental representation (which is
the same as adjoint for this particular group and no other)
is 248-dimensional—it’s the smallest one that does transform in some non-trivial way. The “next” representation is
3875-dimensional. For a lotus that blooms we get entire series
starting from 248, 3875, etc. We do not endorse the theory
of everything view on E8 or any singular symmetry, because
PPM worldview requires the composition of symmetries and
also that depends on which prime point the vortex started to
grow. E8 means, the vectors of the root system are in eightdimensional Euclidean space, for PPM metric as described in
2.6, all Lie group symmetries generate, the lotus is the superposition of all possible symmetry groups.
Historical background: Since 1875, three paradoxes have
ruled several fields of physics, chemistry and biology, ranging from the origin of life to the information loss in a black
hole. First paradox was Gibbs paradox which was created by
equations that contradicted Gibbs law, second paradox was
Maxwell’s demon, where the role of the demon has always
been a suspicious one, the third one is the entropy itself who
played a major role in surviving the other two debates as the
definition of entropy became a matter of personal choice for
the last 130 years. Here, the point of interest is 1955s von
Neumanns computer (N) and a million-year-old yet most
powerful parallel computation machine (P), our central nervous system (CNS). N process data in terms of 0 and 1, while
a neuron burst in a brain is conceptually multilevel (0, 1, 2,
3 … n). There might have been a thermodynamic route to connect N with P, and if a generalized expression for k level logic
could be developed then for k → ∞ we could thermodynamically connect higher-level processors often observed in nature.
Given the fact that processor software deals with information
entropy and hardware deals with thermodynamic entropy, we
cannot proceed further without solving nearly 50 years old
mystery and myth associated with the term entropy.
The second law of thermodynamics, discovered in 1850,
said that in a closed system all real physical process would
consume energy and the system end up with a less amount
than the starting energy. In 1865 when Clausius noticed that
in an ideal gas mix, the ratio of heat exchanged to the absolute
temperature is constant, he named it “entropy.” In 1875 Gibbs
showed that when all gas molecules have the same temperature, heat exchange is zero, therefore entropy is zero. If we plot
entropy with similarity then entropy remains constant till all
molecules come to the same state, then suddenly it falls to zero.
Many equations contradicted this relation, and Gibbs paradox
was born. It survived for more than 120 years because of two
reasons; different kind of entropy came into being and still
their relationship is not clear, secondly some of the very basic
assumptions were not properly changed when different real
situations were considered. Now considering old definitions of
entropy and impossibility of the existence of pure gas, it has
been shown that Gibbs paradox does not exist at all. However,
entropy does not remain constant always, it depends on relative
fraction of the mixed gases and therefore the only minimum

Nanobrain

and maximum entropy remains same as Gibb’s while variation
in between two extremes depends on the system.
In late 1940, von Neumann and Shannon introduced information in entropy. More information is a certainty, certainty is
negative of uncertainty, uncertainty is a disorder, and more disorder involves more energy exchange to reach an equilibrium
that is more entropy. Obviously, the new information entropy
(IE), negative of information is simply a number and different
from the old entropy which is basically thermodynamic entropy
(TE). Several hundreds of attempts have been made to correlate this two, separating them, joining them, even challenging
the Gibbs paradox or misinterpreting the second law of thermodynamics to reach a conclusion. Mystery and myth about
the origin of life have added to this hundred-year-old debate on
real entropy as it continued for the Gibbs paradox case. Both
schools of thought are well investigated in a plethora of models
and systems, therefore following them classically might lead to
the truth, but unless the philosophical ground for IE and TE is
very clear, following the paths would be misleading.
The journey of negative entropy and information:
The breaking adds one phrase to the second law of thermodynamics, that is, the increase in entropy is not continuous,
sometimes it may remain constant and sometimes even may
decrease, it is a very discrete and random behavior, on global
scale entropy increases continuously. It is still a debate where
life form or the emergence of intelligence always feeds on
negative entropy (Von Stockar and Liu, 1999). Since information corresponds to a negative term in total entropy of the
system (Brillouin, 1953), it could easily be modeled to add
complexity in a system (Packel and Traub, 1987). However,
these formulations have a singular view that the weight of
entropy allowed to judge the suitability of a proper computational algorithm in a given scenario rejecting several major
aspects, since homogeneous entropy increment concept is
broken as said above, the whole idea comes under suspicion,
maximum information co-efficient concept is an idea to
resolve this problem via considering the specific features of
an information (Reshef et al., 2011). The situation becomes
very interesting in a quantum scenario, partial information
content due to entanglement depends on the sign, positive or
negative, and that could redefine the information in the sender
and the receiver (Horodeck, 2005).
Basic concepts of information and symmetry: Information
or similarity of a system is asked only at a particular time; therefore, it is a static state, count-number associated with the state
of the elements provides the IE. However literally the word
dynamic at a particular time does not make any sense and
therefore any change occurring between two points of time is
essential to express a dynamic behavior. Literature is full of
contradictory relationships between symmetry and similarity.
Similarity means alike in a certain parameter at a particular
time, symmetry is the sameness measure, therefore in a static
system symmetry=similarity. However, more dynamic is the
system, more elements can some to the same state, similarity increases or decreases at any given time, but that does
not measure sameness. The statistical average of similarity
within a period of time would be the sameness measure or

Big Data in the Garden of Gardens (GOG)—Universal Time Crystal

symmetry. Therefore, more dynamic=more symmetry. It is a
direct and clear relationship used in this letter; any readers
can calculate it for their own system.
The next point in which literature is full of confusion about
the parts should be taken into account for the understanding
of entropy of the system. Studying collisions of molecules
should not involve vibrations of bonds just to provide explanations. It is well conceived that similar things repulse and
opposites attract, but only that part of the system contributes,
which has a significant effect on the length scale the entropy is
measured. A similar charge, spin, mass, dipole, repulse when
system elements are less than a critical distance but if they
are not then they attract, therefore ignoring length scale it is
very easy to survive entropy debate and often challenging the
second law of thermodynamics. The system elements at less
than the critical distance and far beyond cases would be considered by making a clear line of difference. At less than the
critical distance more is the number of similar elements more
is the sum of repulsive interaction energy, therefore more is
the TE (TE=energy exchanged/absolute temperature). If statistically there is a high probability that the system elements
always interact coming closer than the critical distance, then
the above relationship is valid otherwise not. Interestingly,
more is the similar elements in a system, it requires fewer
numbers to express the information content, therefore when
TE increases IE should decrease (IE = logarithm of apparent
symmetry number). The simple logic shows the non-existence
of entropy paradox; because both existing concepts are valid,
contradictory results originate from opposite assumptions.
Therefore, if proved experimentally then it would negate the
existence of several hundreds of models developed to challenge one another in a different perspective. A simple and
careful experiment has been carried out using molecules by
Bandyopadhyay et al. in the brain jelly to check the validity of
entropy debate in light of the above conclusions (Chapter 9).
In principle, since a system cannot return to the initial state
of conformation or information in a closed environment and an
ideal closed system cannot be built, therefore a pseudo-closed
system is used and the evolution of two kinds of entropy with
time is investigated. A pseudo closed system means external
energy exchange should be less than the threshold energy for
the inter-state switching so that there is no external interference during the energy and information exchange process.
If there is a change in the logic state, change in momentum
and finally after repulsion a change in the direction occurs,
then there must have been an effective energy exchange.
TE is calculated theoretically analyzing the Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images, and Density Functional
Theoretical (DFT) computation, and IE is calculated simply
from the logic state derived from STM measurements.
Gibb’s relation and beyond: In the similarity vs thermodynamic entropy plot, nearly a linear relationship holds
between them while for information entropy (IE), the relationship was linear but 90o out of phase. Therefore, a relationship
is established between two different entropies of a particular
system; however, most surprisingly this information entropy
relationship was also obtained by Lin et al. but unfortunately,

135

they have claimed that their relationship is the real entropysymmetry relationship and Gibbs relation or modified Gibbs
relation are both wrong. Above findings show that similar to
Lin et al. hundreds of models which made serious attempt to
evaluate the authentic entropy-symmetry relationship needs
to be re-examined as the question of right and wrong does
not arise at all. Once it is established that similar to Gibbs paradox, no debate should exist for the entropy too, the ground
is set to re-visit the thermodynamic aspects of the computation process in a machine like a human brain. Furthermore,
in order to connect Neumann’s perspective with the central
nervous system, CNS, a clear vision of a solution point is the
necessity, and unless it is known how these two entropies are
related for a particular system the solution point would have
been a vague concept.
At this point, a clarification is needed for the solution
point. In Gibbs relation, the particles have two phases, distinguishable and indistinguishable. Inside a Pentium processor, the 2D surface of the hardware has billions of switches,
during operation or even when it reaches a solution then the
hardware surface is a matrix assigning each element or components either 0 or 1. Therefore, when all the switches are zero or
one then the system is distinguishable otherwise indistinguishable. Now, for any other combination of 0 and 1 in a 2D matrix,
thermodynamically there is energy exchange between switches
in the hardware therefore we have a TE, and if we consider
only the number, then it is easy to determine how far the matrix
from absolute indistinguishability is IE. Therefore, the processor acquires a co-ordinate on the straight line of an entropysymmetry plot, which could also be the solution of a problem.
The reason is that at any given point of time the generalized
path of the system point in the generalized co-ordinate would
be the solution of the problem. It is the thermodynamic interpretation of the Neumann’s computer proposed in 1955.
It is possible to perform validity check experiments on
the second law of thermodynamics in the universe where
there is no reality. It is not possible to build an absolute close
system, and the virtually closed system could be made by
a proper choice of the inherent property of the system elements. Modification of the Gibbs paradox by Neumann’s is
justified, Lin’s philosophy is experimentally verified but his
challenge to the Neumann’s is unjustified as both of them consider different entropies. Neumann investigates information
entropy = (−) similarity = (−) repulsion = (−) thermodynamic
entropy which Lin considers. During the experimental justification of Lin’s proposal, in the brain jelly, multilevel repulsion was observed among different imaginary worlds. During
the information exchange process this gives rise to multilevel
phase evolution, a basis for a multilevel computer. Multiple
phase evolution in a single experiment demands a 3D plot,
which for n → ∞ becomes the representative of a central nervous system. It looks like a lotus flower. We complete a journey from meander flower to a lotus flower. The motion of any
point on this entropy symmetry surface is the thought-like
information exchange process in a central nervous system,
might be in an artificial brain if the equivalent hardware is
ever developed in the future (Chapter 9).

5.8 HOW GEOMETRIC SIMILARITY
BUILDS CREATIVITY IN
COMPUTING PRIMES
First, seeing a typical tree when we resemble it with the dancing girl, or balloon looks like a lozenge, there is no formal
logic. Such familiarities are creative and go beyond algorithmic logic (Figure 5.10a).
Second, the integrated geometries of different kinds of
data may look similar. For example, the relativity and the
painting tricks are similar in geometry, but have no relation

in concept, yet they could fuse affecting each other, wherever
the local geometric matching is there in the respective time
crystals (Figure 5.10b).
Third, even within a very particular type of data, like the
advent of diabetes among masses, we could have totally uncorrelated functions and symmetries in the statistical distribution. However, if local distributions match g­ eometrically, then,
they would build a fractal geometric seed together by combining the geometric seeds (Figure 5.10c).
Fourth, when a fractal tape machine searches for a geometric shape, it can make a mistake. That error is corrected when

information processing. (j) The pairing of primes, silent primes in the statistical distribution of primes in the integer space is another

Big Data in the Garden of Gardens (GOG)—Universal Time Crystal

the 3D geometry hidden in the singularity domain is searched
and properly mapped. A similar error correction runs for the
12 layers (Figure 5.10d).
Fifth, when the symmetries of the randomly obtained
geometric shapes from the events happening around nature
are compiled and the corresponding PPM is built, similar
geometric shapes are found to repeat over the integer space.
The projected geometric shape means finding visually connected, irrespective of conceptually non-connected features.
Thus, it is not logical (Figure 5.10e).
Sixth, a time crystal architecture holding the entire information could project different temporal patterns at different
solid angles, all around it (Figure 5.10f).
Seventh, PPM have three-tier control on the evolution of
a time crystal or the information architecture (Figure 3.16).
First, the sensory layer, where the ordered factor metric or OF
metric acts in converting the sensory data. Above this layer,
a hierarchical control on the lower level metrics is made by
a prime composition metric or PC metric. Above that there
is a prime gap metric or PG metric that looks into the symmetry of the primes used. Three layers, operate together, one
above another. The symmetry of symmetries of symmetries is
beyond logical predictions (Figure 5.10g).
Eighth, in reality, the elements of quaternion, octonion
and dodecanion or icosanion are time crystals. The elements of icosanion tensor could be a dodecanion, the elements of a dodecanion tensor could be an octonion and
those octonions would have quaternion elements. Thus,
the nested time crystal elements could build distinct geometric pathways which could connect in the time domain
(Figure 5.10h).
Ninth, one of the finest features of a coupled feedback
network-facing each other is that they work like two mirrors facing each other for the geometric information. While
reflecting back and forth, the geometric information could
build up architecture by interaction (Figure 5.10i).
Tenth, primes, because of their own distinct feature are
silent when statistically one measures the contribution
of a prime in a given database of integers (Figure 3.8g).
The transition of a prime from silent to a dominant contributor is not linear as the number of integer increases,
the relative ups and downs of the ranking of most dominating primes in a given dataset are oscillatory, and geometric
(Figure 5.10j).

5.9 THE WHEEL OF INTELLIGENCE—
DIFFERENCE FROM HUMANS
Will this be a universal computing machine? A computation is universal if it can emulate any other computation.
Emulating a particular computation C means that we can
feed a certain code into our universal computation U that
will cause U to produce the same input-output behavior
as (Zwirn and Delahaye, 2013). Brain jelly is a PPM synthesizer, specific to the input time crystal, if we want to
execute generalized computing in this material (Chapter 9).

137

Therefore, if a programmable matter say brain jelly is
designed and synthesized to exhibit a large part of the frequency band for electric, magnetic, and mechanical resonance, then, it can emulate part of the rhythms, irrespective
of its limitless possibilities, those are bounded by certain
repetitive rules. Of course, we do admit that even then,
mathematically it could be proved that an absolute universality cannot be achieved.
The ability to replicate all possible rhythms is
not just enough for universal computing: The objective
of PPM based non-computation is to use minimum resource
yet reaching the solution faster than the natural system
using nested rhythms just like an avalanche (Figure 5.11).
If the advent of cancer disease takes 120 years to reach
to a metastasis state, it would be wise to use a replica of
nested rhythms for cancer at shorter time scale so that we
can predict it within a few minutes. It means ultra-fast
events need to be lengthened and ultra-slow events need
to be shortened in the time scale to perform a meaningful computing or emulation. Make ultra-fast events slow
and slow events fast: Normally, if a natural computer is
able to replicate a natural event by increasing its speed
by 1016 times, or by decreasing its speed by 1016 times,
we can cover the majority of natural phenomena that
evolves in our known universe. That means de facto the
proposed non-computer nanobrain would be a universal
one. For example, we shall always try to predict supernovae explosion in a few months, since it takes billions
of years for a star to become supernovae. Whereas, the
artificial natural event that would construct the time crystal for a single electron tunneling event should capture it
in the femtosecond or picosecond time scale, but then by
fractal feature, clock it in seconds or hours. Self-similar
feature of the time crystal would bring femtosecond event
to seconds so that we can observe the evolution of ultrafast event in the classical time-domain and analyze how
it evolves with time. Two experimental verifications are
explained in Chapter 4. So, we expect organic nanobrain
to study several animal dynamics by itself, learn and then
suggest a particular jelly architecture that would exhibit
the necessary mobility features in the real world just like
the humans do (Figure 5.12). Afterward, the machine
would choose a set of PPMs need to be incorporated into
the brain of that robot, and suggest a pattern-evolving
grid, finally suggest the necessary rhythm composition
rules for that grid. Events occurring in nature are not random. Random events integrate from one singular metric.
That metric is closely related to the vibrations of dielectric resonators (Lauber et al., 1994; Pistolesi and Manini,
2000; Pechal et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2011; Joshi and Χiao,
2006). The other criterion is the space constraint. We cannot use the entire mass or all components in a brain jelly to
emulate the replica of a nested rhythm or time crystal, the
entire process needs to be generated among the cluster of
a few participants. Therefore, universal computing using
PPM machine demands both spatial and temporal resource
management as outlined in Figure 5.11.

5.10 COULD PRIME-BASED COMPUTING
PREDICT THE FUTURE WITHOUT
PRIOR KNOWLEDGE?
In the culture of Turing-based information processing, be it classical or quantum, we deal with facts as absolute truth, gathered
earlier. Here, in this book the paradigm of computing is advocated for non-facts like confusions. We do not take any facts in
the new paradigm. We start with confusion, and make a journey
through it, by asking question, “how many confusions have built
this higher-level confusion?” Then, take one of the sub-layer confusion and go inside and ask the same question. When, we reach
a known fact we do not enter. Now, the architecture of confusion
is the map that helps us to understand the unknown. Figure 5.13
lists a series of factors why can we predict future in the fractal
tape machine paradigm, but not in the earlier paradigms.
First, when events are represented as geometric shapes, the
symmetry comes into play. It is true that events could happen
in infinite ways, but the number of symmetries is finite. So,
the geometricization of events ensures that events are classified in terms of symmetry. The geometric language, GML has
15 letters as 15 geometric shapes, hence, fusion of different
sensory signals into one architecture is possible.

Second, when linking of events in all possible ways is
mapped in terms of patterns of 15 primes, the metric of primes
estimates all possible combinations of discrete events. Since
the user assigns a typical composition of primes to a typical
event, when a new composition of those primes appears, or
even a new set of primes are linked, we get future possibilities.
Third, the geometric seed of various higher-level integration of events are integrators and the projector of future
possibilities.
Fourth, a proper manifold mapping of the interaction of
different imaginary worlds is recorded in the quaternion,
octonion, dodecanion, and icosanion tensors. Thus, hierarchical maps of 12 layers one above another ensures projecting the
future in a proper manner.

5.11 HOW PRIME-BASED ARTIFICIAL
BRAIN SHRINKS BIG DATA?
Just two conceptual changes in defining what is “information” and its preferred “integration” do wonders in the
existing information theory (EIT, classical + quantum
information theory). Information is the 11D geometric

pattern of primes which is an archive of how to link symmetries to integrate information. Here, the universe cannot
be linearized or sequentialized, the purity of fractal geometric feature has to be preserved. Now we cite 10 reasons
why FIT can use much fewer resources to solve the “data
deluge” and “astronomic algorithm” problems, while EIT
cannot (Figure 5.14).
1. Information is squeezed into a fractal seed that
repeats to regenerate the original: We do not store
entire pixel-based data, convert it into a geometry of
clocks. Not randomly, we build a fractal of fractals,
following 11D time crystal’s symmetry and the
pattern of primes to find how to make the nested
seeds of clocking geometry so that when the user
implements the fractal expansion following a
metric of primes, it retrieves the original pattern.
Therefore, the fractal seed is a drastically reduced
3D geometry of clocks for the original geometric
structure. Earlier in the old information processing
theory, when the volume and intricate details of the
content was important, not symmetry. FIT classifies

the content basic on self-similarity of significance.
Here fractal seeds are topologically filtered to a
particular location of the hardware.
2. The maximum change in the physical space is
less than the length of minimum wavelength:
We could use one choice or imaginary path for
making another loop, changes we need to make in
the device geometry is very little. Thus, resources
required do not increase exponentially. Just imagine with 10 states one inside another, we can have
11+10 + 9+8+ 7+6+ 5+ 4 +3+ 2 +1
108…
= 1066 states. In other words
8 .
8 = 8 + 8 + 8..., we linearize the power by fractal
hardware. It is a massive reduction in complexity.
Since the whole architecture is a geometric arrangement of spheres, from the center of the structure 3D
projections to different direction provides different
information. Same architecture could hold conceptually distinct information, no need for new hardware,
simply by changing the relative orientation of two
structures one could add a huge amount of information in a system as time crystals, without adding a
new resource.

3. Since only one parameter, phase represents all
information, no resources required for compilation, transformation, addition, storage, even memorizing = processing etc. To add a new phase to an
oscillating body, it does not require a physical space.
There is only one dynamics of phase change that
generates the “resting state,” hence no need for
varieties of phenomena and their theories: Who
selects direction? Who selects the motion? Who
selects the number of system points? Who selects the
phase? Motion is selected by an evolution of phase,
and a negative and positive sign of a phase selects
the direction of rotation. One could add new system points and generate a completely new kind of
dynamics in the same geometric structure without adding a single new resource.
4. Total information remains constant, yet one could
run an infinite series in finite hardware: harvesting infinity is feasible by projection: If certain
topology is acquired by time crystal then we do
not need infinite resources or materials, one sphere
could hold an infinite set of clocks by creating an
infinite series of oscillations, could be analyzed
using continued fraction geometric algebra. In terms
of symmetry and dynamics, the choices are finite for
any complexity of information. Adding a new singularity does not require space, simply by adjusting
the phase of neighboring clocks in a geometric structure one could add a new set of singularities, which
means creating a new geometric architecture. Plenty
of system points along with the multi-direction oriented planes parallely rotate on the imaginary phase
sphere. Hence, four parameters, time gap between
two singularities, system point starting location,
rotational directions of all time cycles (both, starting phase and rotational directions are determined
by projection distinction on the reality sphere), (orientations of the planes are fixed = number of system
points) are used to build up the information structure as universal time crystal. The line connecting
the phase sphere’s (previously Bloch sphere) center
to the system point on the spherical surface get the
information. Therefore, the complexity increases but
total information remains constant.
5. An intricate pattern of lights and darkness
change their shape, it holds the dynamics of
the events, no wiring required, no electronic
devices are essential: We find the 3D distribution
of knots of darkness and free dark particles, also
the knots of lights and free light particles in the
data space, find the geometric pattern of dynamics (see Chapter 8 for details). The devices follow
flux-charge protocol instead of a current-voltage
protocol. Here power supply or energy consumption is not a prime concern, but geometry and
dielectric constant of the material is which is a
function of symmetry.

141

6. New memory is written on an old memory,
no need for an exclusive new space for a new
memory, they may share a common space:
Experimentally, adding a new loop of poles means
making changes in a group of ET cavities such that
little changes make no notice locally, but when we
see globally all participant cavities together, it’s
“the” pattern that is evident. It is the reason, we do
not need to delete memories, all information are
basic geometric shapes only, just connect them
suitably; a new memory simultaneously exist with
the old memory.
7. Singular one to all connection at the top: “Umbrella
protocol,” “superposition of many circuits in a
single hardware”: Nested clock retrieves a higher
level perception correlation, since, “everything
is connected to everything” and at a higher level
it is easier to find the total path, hence any problem reaches to the top first, like an umbrella. In a
sequential circuit system, everything is connected to
everything is not possible. Here, in the same hardware one could connect memory elements using a
network of phase, clocking direction, topological
symmetry, a pattern of silence, the orientation of
a particular plane of symmetries, 11D dynamic
map’s similarity in tensor algebra, etc. Moreover,
to add a new umbrella we do not need any new
hardware.
8. Fractal net of clocks: “instantaneous solution”:
Fractal clock enables processing and analyzing at the
“fractal seed” at a much deeper level than the reader’s
processing layer, which runs very fast. A task to be
processed at a slower clock is actually solved in the
domains of the fastest clocks and then the solution
is returned to the slower clock. There is no search
of the database even since due to symmetric fractal architecture, there are spontaneous replies by the
system, it performs a search without searching.
9. Unitary drive in the reality sphere at all levels of
information integration: Perpetual drive to reduce
the system “unitary,” An “unitary drive”: Perpetual
self-assembly for the reduction of arguments into
15 geometric shapes, never delinks from the entire
environment of universal time crystal without users
note but generates a drive to make the time cycle unitary. The structure finds shorter and better routes by
rotating the inner planes. Even though a user does
not encode intelligence, the system’s unitary drive
induces a self-drive for that. Geometric language
could not be applied if there is no unitary drive.
10. Various exclusively topological processing, the
geometric symmetry breaking, phase transition
etc by using a fusion fractal tape (FF tape) via
morphological transformations of time crystal:
Geometric connection, geometric information, use
of singularity, the new information theory that are
fundamental to FIT and GML carries with it fractal

142

decomposition of bursts from singularity The nested
phase network = information. Simpler geometry of
clocks, replaces the complex clock network.
11. FIT-GML protocol does not have to hold in memory the actual information content during processing, hence the size of the information content
is not important: One has to find the periodically
oscillating dynamic points in a topology of the distribution of data, create a 3D network of topology
to find intricate phase relationships between a large
number of clock patterns. Finding the same phase
oscillations of the brightest and the darkest points in
a 3D cloud like representation of data is the actual
mechanism of information processing.
12. No need to understand the language following
which the information is written: In any given
information space, irrespective of any mode or
methodology of presenting information dynamics,
PPM-GML-H triad protocol finds symmetry in the
dynamics with 99% accuracy. So, we do not need to
understand other dynamics, or how they have written it. Hence does not require an algorithm, all
senders and receivers are encoded with a similar
prime metric hardware, to determine how symmetries to be linked is a universal governing rule.

5.12 THE LIMITATIONS AND INCREDIBLE
FEATURES OF PRIME-BASED COMPUTING
What is non-computing? Definition of a non-computer
(Reddy, S. et al., 2018): (a) The number of choice and quantity of information increase during decision-making instead
of reduction. (b) No finite statement is found, all statements
are fractal, not overlapped (Paterson, 1974). (c) There is no
sequence of events, it is always event inside an event, i.e., a
fractal thread. (d) No measurement happens here, superposed
possibilities coexist as a distinct state. The observer becomes
an integral part of the morphing of entire information content
written as a time crystal. (e) All decisions are logically circular. Nothing exists without a closed-loop, even non-periodic
events. (f) There is no data or fact as the decision. It is always
a shape-changing geometry, the habit of looking at numbers
for solutions is unfound here. (g) All solutions are incomplete.
They are extended from the beginning to the end of the hardware structure. (h) Halting is never there, decision-making
never stops, output continues, converges, spontaneously starts
rebuilding. (i) Decision-making happens in the phase network of time crystal. Mostly, the signals remain the same,
only the phase changes. So literally an observer detects no
ongoing computation, still, a decision is made. (j) There is no
question and answer or argument, only situations. An intractable Clique problem (searching a key pattern in a complex
pattern) is solved bypassing its criticality (Feige et al., 1991;
Ghosh et al., 2014a). (k) The user or observer does not write
instruction. Instead “metric of prime, PPM is the programmer, it replaces the user.” (l) There is no forced input. User

does not search inside the hardware. Using geometric grammar, it searches its environment for input.
Here are some of the incredible features of the PPM class
of computing.
1. Search a massive database without searching (spontaneous reply).
2. Multiple nested clocks one inside another enable “a
virtual instant decision-making”
3. No programming is required as “cycles self-assemble/
dis-assembly for better sync at all possible time scales
simultaneously.”
4. “Phase space” keeps “volume intact” as required
resources only increase phase density not real space.
Information = wiring geometry (hardware);
Information = silence (not “bing” Philosophy);
Information = Phase (geometric); Information =
Perimeter or diameter (parametric).
5. Perpetual spontaneous editing of slower time cycles
(creation/destruction/defragmentation) “prepare for
unknown” = higher-level learning.
6. FIT introduces “fractal resolution,” a complex
signal’s lowest and fastest time scale signals are
absorbed, simultaneously, and during expansion, the
fractal seed delivers full output, from a seed of information (drastic shrinking of data).
7. The superposition of simultaneously operating a million paths assembles into a sphere enables “extreme
parallelism.” In quantum, only one Bloch sphere,
here sphere inside a sphere inside a sphere...
8. Time cycle is a memory, rotation along the cycle is
processing, are same events, “no transport needed
between memory and processing units,” no wiring,
no communication, no communication channel.
9. No logic gate, no reduction of choices, which ensures
that “speed” is irrelevant. No bits or Qubits. The object is
not measured by an observer, the object being observed
is not a separate thing, i.e., no measurement. Observer,
Object and Environment integrates into the time cycle
(time cycle = unit of information = an event). A question is assimilated into the internal network of time
cycles it affects the environment and observer in the
course of assimilation. That is how a solution is derived,
no computing is done to find an answer.
10. All sensory information is converted to one geometric language that allows “perception,” a yellow color
could have a taste. Perception is not programming as
wrongly perceived.
11. It never requires rebooting, only one computing runs
for whole life, but of course it sleeps when it switches
off certain interactive links with nature, yet even at that
time all three internal rhythm networks run. Rebooting
means temporary switching of the internal rhythm
integrator. It is an equivalence of consciousness.
12. The information structure self-edits itself continuously. It always spontaneously defragments
the internal structure of the complete information

143

content represented as time crystal. However, selfediting is not so profound at the boundary clocks of
a time crystal structure. There is a Gaussian distribution of editing efficiency in a time crystal architecture, the clocks in the central region edit the
maximum. There are various reasons why this is so
essential. (i) Boundaries cannot be so vulnerable to
changes, (ii) editing requires a high density of clock
boundaries, (iii) job description leaves only clocks in
the middle to memorize environments, while faster
clocks need to memorize hardware management, the
slower clocks require to sync with the environment.
Limitations of a fractal machine: The reason that makes
Fractal machine more powerful than the Turing machine
is responsible for its weakness (Figure 5.15). A number of
weaknesses of the fractal machine have been outlined by
Gregor Drummen. First, higher level perception based on a
hierarchical network of platonic geometries enable fractal
machine to convert all forms of energy level signals into a
singular language. That very feature also ensures a judgment

error. For example, a red ball could be perceived as an apple,
rope as a snake, etc. Second, since the user, machine and environment are all time crystals locked by cycles of rhythms,
the machine is always ready for unknown situations, here
unknown means, not encoded inside the machine. For the
same reason, the machine requires to regulate and update
rhythms of the environment perpetually. If mismatch is more
than the machine’s tolerance limit, it needs to go to sleep, so
that geometric shapes rearrange to a stable structure. Third,
a self-assembly of algorithm enables self-learning of the
machine, writing its own software, but it can lead to irreproducible production of the non-computing machine in the
industry. Since the fractal network evolves with learning, the
chances are limited to recover if things go wrong. However,
one thing is certain, the non-computing would not be limited to conscious expressions of life. A massive database of
personalized PPM for each living and non-living systems in
and beyond this planet would unveil the geometric correlations of time and space and repeatedly derive all the fundamental constants that distinguish physics, finally derive all
laws from no laws (Wheeler, 1980). Only a few primes—and

FIGURE 5.15 A chart describing the limitations of the non-computing, a new kind of decision-making using fractal tape.

144

explain the existence itself—as the similarly self-generated
organ-like metrics of a self-synthesized information system
(Haken 1988).
Critical challenges and the weaknesses of a noncomputer: (i) A non-computer is not precisely accurate. It gives
a global idea or perspective. A non-computer is like a life form,
good at those kinds of problems that it solves most. Given different kinds of problems, a shadow of the past analytic protocols is
reflected. (ii) Speed makes no sense, the total time of decisionmaking is fixed. Decision-making cannot end in principle. An
observer or user of the non-computer captures a solution based
on its own time resolution. (iii) Blindly trusts the metric prime,
PPM as an encoder for all possible dynamics in the universe
instead of a human user. The dynamics related to millions of
primes are left out. It is similar to the culture of conventional
computers, which trust that all events in the universe could be
sequentialized. (iv) All 10 deliverables of non-computing are
abstract in nature, not factual during processing. (v) Instead of
signal the phase or silence between a pair of signals holds the key
information. A 3D network of silence is the unit of information,
not bits. Hence, particular clocks work (Bandyopadhyay et al.,
2006a, 2006b, 2010a; Bandyopadhyay and Wakayama, 2007)
but a switch alone fails. (vi) Wiring does not work; one-to-many
and many-to-one communication is required (Bandyopadhyay
et al., 2010b, 2010c). Hardware needs a wireless communication and a fractal network with a null screening effect (Jaeger
and Haas, 2004). Here is it achieved by anomalous quantum
cloaking, which enables key processing devices to sense and
communicate only essential device, make others invisible. (vii)
Non-computing never stops, it slows down at synchrony of
clocks. Therefore, there is no static output. The answer depends
on the time when the question is asked, how the question is
asked i.e. observer’s time crystal. Depending on the observer
location around the observed, the solution changes significantly.
(viii) In the conventional computer, noise disrupts the system.
Here, noise is fed to activate the synchrony, finding the symmetry that matches most with the PPM. Moreover, an ordered
signal affects the decision-making negatively. (ix) Addition of
resource has no value. It is not the number of elements but the
distinct sets of vibrations in distinct symmetries that make a
powerful non-computer. (x) The solution has to be taken from
all over the fractal hardware, as a projected output. There is no
output and input location.
Entanglement is one-way traffic: Coexistence of clocks
is multi-channel traffic: Quantum computing is primitive:
In a quantum computer, an exponential speedup is caused

a fairly limited technology. Often, we encounter a situation
where each time crystal can simultaneously be part of several
other time crystals operating in a distantly located PPM-based
independent system. The demand is far more technologically
advanced than that offered by entanglement driven quantum
computing. By analogy, this is like a person playing one drum
in time with one group of drummers and another in time with
a different, faster group of drummers, or playing cello in tune
with one group and an oboe with another. Such wiring of time
is possible by complicated phase relation between different
systems. Electromagnetic resonance induced quantum cloaking ensures that a large number of entangled systems coexist
independently, operate dependently for some conditions and
independently for others. Fractal mechanics of multi-layered
imaginary worlds is the key.
Energy conservation principle: PPM computing does
not require Landau limits for elementary operation: In a
PPM hardware, all clocks in the entire fractal tape run continuously, decision-making means a subtle integration in the phase
space. Total energy pumped to the system always remains constant, the entire computing hardware does not require additional energy supply. The hardware is designed not to absorb
any further energy, the total energy content only redistributes
over the matrix. During information processing system we
have a surface where energy redistributes like Gaussian 3D
wave packets. The distribution of energy changes but the total
energy is conserved. It is a closed system, by landau principle,
bits do not change here that requires energy supply.
Limiting the PPM computer: Markov process and
Devils staircase: The specialization of necessity and preparedness is one weakness of current computers. In the
probability theory and statistics, a Markov process, is a timevarying random phenomenon for which memory-less-ness survives. Then, the property depends on the present state of the
system, its future and past are independent, so it is called
memory-­­less-ness. For the pattern of primes, no memory
is required other than the memory of the metric, or how are
primes around? The second weakness is that during training,
brain jelly may not learn properly. In this case, the whole
computer would be adding nonsense perspective to everything. The third weakness is that, just like humans, it can
make errors of perception. Finally, this computer is not good
at solving simple problems like 2 + 2 = 4, and the accuracy
is significantly compromised; existing computers are much,
much better in this case. Since all, time crystals have an upper
and a lower frequency, at certain limiting scales we find that
signal takes constant values except at subset of points where
it changes continuously, this is called Devil’s staircase.

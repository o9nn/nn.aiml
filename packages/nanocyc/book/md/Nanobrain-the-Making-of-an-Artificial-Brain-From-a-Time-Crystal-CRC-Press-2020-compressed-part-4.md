From the endpoint of the spinal cord (Mulasringata\~corpus callosum) to
the pons (mahasivapada\~brain stem, which is frequently written as
"parama pada" too) the power of rising from sleeping (Kundalini)
resides, an eternal wish to rise that comes from a point and passes
through the five elements of the universe, to finally connect the
supreme point of pons (brain stem) to the universal consciousness. That
very point (mahasivapada, paramapada) is going global (byapaka) and it
pervades all of them to connect it to the soul.

Phase Prime Metric (PPM) Links All Symmetries in Our Universe and
Governs Nature's Intelligence

1.  **TEN CLASSES OF PHASE PRIME METRIC (PPM)---A PATTERN OF PRIMES**

**How physics laws were born: **It is not possible that phys-ics laws
were born one by one after the universe got created. Not before, not
after, just at the moment the universe was born (Steenrod, 1962). We
leave the debate on the origin of the uni-verse to astrophysicists
(Weil, 1951), instead get concerned about the demand for the pure
information architecture of the universe. Phase prime metric (PPM) is a
pattern of primes to create integers in various ways, and it is only a
principle of organization of symmetries, which is no organization of
other elementary concepts or system or entity. A metric of primes is not
a derivative; it is original, primitive. Metric means to measure, here,
in PPM, phase relations that might bind dis-tantly located integers is
measured. There is not one, but sev-eral forms of PPM as outlined in ,
which accounts for different kinds of dynamics that number system
follows. Some metric act as a glue that links discrete events together
and forms a time crystal. A typical metric exclusively pro-vides
direction of a clock. A particular metric provides the scaling law of
primes or ripples in the integration of clocks. In the history of
mathematics literature, several attempts were made to find relations
between the primes, detecting a new prime. When we mention, the pattern
of primes, it means the pattern created by prime numbers to build
integers, not link-ing the primes themselves. Only one available work is
in the literature (Reddy et al., 2018). When we use the term, PPM, it
means a composition of a large number of metrics, it is a

system of operators as compiled in the table of . Ten classes of metrics
in are so versatile, that one could discover those relations as soon as
Reddy et al. consid-ered that the primes have no identity, they combine
to build integers. By considering the collective identity of primes as
geometric, they opened the pandora's box. The compo-sition routes of
primes are not random, there are plenty of geometric arts yet to
unravel. The patterns of primes appear distinct, but they have a close
relation in between. Here, we compile largely ignored artworks by
several amature scien-tists and mathematicians between the neighboring
integers when viewed with the eyes of prime numbers. With geometric
musical language (GML) such pattern of primes provides a form free logic
loop made of clocking geometric shapes. It is a closed circuit of
transformations from one geometric shape to another, the sides of
geometric shapes are either integers or primes as described in Chapter
2. Each prime is distinct, pure and generates a unique self-similar fold
in the surface of a 3D metric. For 15 significant prime numbers, one
could quickly identify 15 different dynamic features as shown in each
resembling a typical physical phenomenon and asso-ciated with the
fundamental constants found in nature. We have outlined a summary of
these findings in Chapter 10. Therefore, the physics laws could be
associated with the self-similar curvature in the metric of prime, PPM.
Thus, PPM is self-referential, deductive axiomatic system (Weil, 1951;
Steenrod, 1962).

"go beyond Turing" (Copeland and Proudfoot, 1999). It started by von
Neumann to build a non-von-Neumann machine; how-ever, incompleteness
remained beyond the adventures of an engineering lab. The quest
continued with Turing in 1953, with an attempt to building non-Turing
machines, patterns that create spontaneously, one such class is
hypercomputing (Siegelman, 1995). Feynman proposed to "replace all
physi-cal laws with changing patterns" in 1962 (Feynman, 1965) further
advanced by several authors (Sahu et al., 2009, 2012), possibly inspired
by Conway's game of life in the 1960s. The quest never stopped, it
continued with a series of works to make computing nature-inspired
(Ridge et al., 2005). In 2010, Feynman's suggestion that patterns would
replace the phys-ics laws turned out to be true, at least for some
physical phe-nomena. Two physical events were emulated using quantum
properties of molecular clocks (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010b, 2010c) on a
group of molecules in the monolayer. First, the evolution of cancer
cells. Second, the diffusion of electrons on a grid of molecules. The
result was obvious. Cellular automa-ton works as a non-Turing machine
(Sahu et al., 2009, 2012). Two events were emulated, but it would
require new hardware every time one tries to emulate a new natural
phenomenon.

**Hacking nature using a PPM: **Non-Turing does not mean absolute
randomness, or imaginary, every part of it should be undefined. The
quest for a universal system ranged from the neural network
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2010a), to deep learning, the
efforts to confusing a cell in the Turing tape is fooling it, not
setting a new pathway beyond Turing. All efforts to go beyond failed
because the undefined routes were never explored; a journey through
singularity was considered impossible. Instead of facts no one looked
into the architecture of confusion, mapping confusions. No one believed,
a journey through confusion that ends with facts could solve a problem.
In summary, a century-old saga of failed attempts tell one thing, find a
way to make a jour-ney through undefined pathways, if defined, nothing
can stop converting it into a Turing machine. A dielectric resonance
artist would consider that everything in this universe is made of
dielectric resonators, everything vibrates at specific fre-quencies, be
it mechanical, ionic, electrical, magnetic, nuclear (Lauber et al.,
1994; Pistolesi and Manini, 2000; Pechal et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2011;
Joshi and Χiao, 2006). For this world-view, one can calculate the
geometric correlation between the resonance frequencies ranging from the
Planks scale to the

largest dimension of the universe, as an endless chain of reso-nators,
one inside another. Then that chain of vibration where resonance peaks
reside inside a peak would be an undefined pathway. If a system B is
made of system A alone, B is non-existent without A, then AЖiB
represents the system. Ж is a mathematical operation described in
Chapter 4. On mul-tiple occasions in nature, the ratio of resonance
frequencies of biomaterials follow the pattern of primes. Sahu et al.
first observed the pattern of primes while monitoring the vibra-tions of
microtubule nanowires (Sahu et al., 2013a, 2013b). Who wrote the
geometric shapes in the proteins, why did they write it? Then, is that
pattern of primes universal, writ-ten everywhere in the brain to the
cosmos? It was historically used by many researchers to claim that the
compositions of primes connect everything in the universe (Haramein,
2001; Tomes, 1990). If true, every single system in nature is a PPM and
hardware inspired by this PPM should absorb the infor-mation in nature
as is. During absorption, it will not destroy the 3D integration of
events as geometric shapes. Even if a small fraction of total
information if absorbed as geometric shape, PPM would add geometric
shapes to extrapolate that into total information (Horodeck et al.,
2005). Thus, PPM hardware would analyze events that have not yet
happened by using the metric of primes. Consequently, PPM would hack
nature, copy and paste it in the hardware. Therein one would see nature,
the way it unfolds.

**Ten classes of PPM: a journey of geometric shapes: **Pattern of primes
should link integers, but in reality, as we would see below, PPM
signifies symmetry of the geometric structures more. Several versions of
the PPM reveal all possible dynamics, symmetry breaking, phase
transition, and morpho-genesis of the geometric shapes, whose sidearms
ratios are the integers. also notes the physical significance
asso-ciated with a particular metric. Either one could calculate the
ordered factor of an integer, which is simply finding the divisors of an
integer and arranging them, as shown in using balls. In this figure, one
could nest the prime number of balls representing an integer in various
ways. For example, one could find how many compositions of primes
generate an integer, for example, for *N *= 12, we can count 3 (2 × 2 ×
3, 2 × 3 × 2, 3 × 2 × 2) or even 8 if all possibilities are taken into
account. In other words, how do we perceive an integer, that approach
could lead to a very different kind of geometric shapes for a metric.
The possibilities are plenty. Following ten protocols, three modules are
made, as a core decision-maker (Ghosh et al., 2014b). They are Sensors
to sense the environment. Initiator fil-ters and makes decisions. The
processor stores the learned situ-ations. Regulator filters the learning
parts and evolves the entire architecture. The four hardware modules
operate independently in the non-computer or artificial brain core.
Together, they have a purpose. Specific features of a hardware increases
the length of its operational PPM, i.e., the highest integer, up to
which the pattern of primes one should be drawn.

Ten different patterns of a metric act coherently to frame an event. As
said in Chapter 2, an event is a geometric shape whose corners touch the
phase sphere with infinite pathways connecting the corners in a loop. A
system point runs through

the loop. PPM is not a random structure (Li and Yorke, 1975) though it
never repeats. A generic operator "phase prime met-ric" puts an
intricate geometric detail of the event in nature. One represents an
event as a stream of waves, then the phase-signal relationship is
written as a few geometric shapes in a network of clocks. Then write
that geometry as a set of inte-gers in the metric structure. Integers
are product of primes, so, primes make structures inside the structure
made by an inte-ger. PPM can geometrically link the phase of two events
sepa-rated by a singularity barrier. Quantum computing can do this once
(Zhou et al., 2013), but PPM based computing is built on an interactive
twelve imaginary worlds, where there could be no need ever to come to
reality. For a given number of vertices (icosahedron has 12 vertices),
there could be choices for multiple 3D architectures, and or multiple
compositions of distinct geometric shapes. Moreover, when we activate a
silent integer between a pair of active integers in the PPM, it could
link the neighboring integers in many different confor-mations. Thus, a
PPM extrapolates an event to the unknown future. We would explore all
these magical interplays between integers in the ten sections, one
section each for a particular class of metric.

**Recreating nature in a PPM non-computer: **The prin-ciple of
decision-making by using a triangular combination of PPM, GML, and
fourth-circuit element H. Nature uses the triplet protocols to integrate
the primary events to construct a complex event in the same manner as
the primes integrate to form an integer. Since a typical group of primes
repeats in constituting multiple integers (2, 2 × 2, 2 × 2 × 2...),
eventu-ally, most integers are connected via common primes. Thus, bonded
by multiple groups of primes, or symmetries (2 × 3, 2 × 2 × 3 × 3, 2 × 2
× 2 × 3 × 3 × 3...), the entire integer space acts a singular network of
symmetry made of a few primes, as argued in the . It is a beautiful plot
to show that 15 primes are enough to build a language of symmetry that
nature would follow. The symmetry is conserved; it breaks only when an
event happens, a change in integer emulates this physical process. In
the previous Chapter 2, we learned that to convert all integers into a
geometric shape, we do not require infinite, but only a few say 15, 1D,
2D, and 3D shapes, which could assemble one inside another to reflect
any symmetry of primes. As said, since, a group of primes repeats,
several discretely spaced integers are connected in a hierarchical
net-work of geometric shapes. To sense, to memorize or to make
decisions, we search for the common geometric shapes in the events
happening around us in nature. Bring those matched shapes to the integer
series that integrates the events by bridg-ing the gaps by adding the
missing shapes. Finally, the integer series can fuse, extrapolate,
reduce, transform, or morph the discrete events into a single geometric
shape as output, we would see how intricately geometric it is, below.

**How does a metric make a journey through the singularity: **Two
concepts irritate a pure mathematician. First, when a physical
significance is attached to an inte-ger or a mathematical process as we
do it here. Second, free from the materialistic attachment,
mathematicians do not like undefined singularities holding a geometric
shape.

**FIGURE 3.2 **(a) The development of a phase prime metric or PPM. There
are two sub-panels. In the top, we show an array of balls in a single
line representing the integers. For each linear arrangement of balls,
groups of balls are tagged which could vibrate together as single phase
space. All possible compositions for a single linear array are shown
below the line. By changing the order we get different combina-tions
here, e.g., 2 × 3 is not equal to 3 × 2. In the bottom panel we plot the
count of group compositions we can make from a single number. This
number is also the number of degenerate solutions for the generic
oscillations of a string. (b) The contribution for a particular prime in
the integer space is counted. For example, prime 2 contribute to 50% of
all possible integers in the number system. For each prime while
calculating the contribution, only its contribution alone is calculated,
for example 6 could be counted for 3 and 2, we have counted 6 only once
for 2, not 3. Similarly we have counted for 15 primes and reached total
contribution of 15 primes to 99.99%. (c) The degeneracy plot of panel
(a) is rotated along the integer axis, the total number of rotational
angles is 15 and their contributions are plotted in the XY plane while
the degeneracy is plotted along the Z-axis. (d) In the panel (c) and the
panel (a), the continuously decreasing contributions of primes are
ignored and all 15 primes are given equal contributions 24 degrees. Then
the bottom plot in panel (a) is rotated 360 degrees to get the plots of
panel (d) bottom to top.

How could one element that does not have an identity, have a
significance? Corners of a geometric shape are made of sin-gularities,
and even here we assign a size of phase values to a singularity. When
the clocks run, or a system point moves through the close loop
connecting the corners of a geomet-ric shape, at the singularity points
one hears "burst," and all-around nature, the singularity points are
known to cre-ate bursts (Mallat and Hwang, 1992). The time gap between a
pair of "bursts" tells us the phase gap. The ratios of the phases
between periodic events hold the geometric param-eters. Journey through
singularity means entering inside a burst to find another set of bursts
within the primary burst. It is difficult to picturize how could many
bursts be hidden inside a single large burst. It is very much possible
that a single burst from a singularity that we sense is actually an
illusion, higher resolution would reveal that it is not 1 but a pentagon
or hexagon hidden inside, whose five or six sin-gularities are bursting
off. Thus, one could enter inside one

then find 3, and inside each of the three bursts, find some more
geometries. Each layer would count the total number of bursts, those are
integers that is all a PPM requires to build an architecture of choices.
An external sensor could lock on any part of the hardware. Due to two
limiting time resolu-tions of the sensor, the fastest clock and the
slowest clock are selected naturally. Thus, decision-making fixes the
end of computing before even it begins synchronization.

1.  **15 Primes ContriBute to 99.99%**

**of all integers in the universe**

In , one gets the freedom to insert the balls inside a ball, a nested
grouping of balls, within and above, naturally explains why ordering is
so important. When one takes three balls first and then inserts two
balls inside, we get a group of six balls, but that architecture is very
different if we take two balls first and insert three balls in each of
the two. Counting is

the same but the geometric significance is different. To build a PPM
along the horizontal axis the integers are plotted and the vertical axis
shows the number of compositions of primes required to represent the
corresponding integer. When we connect the choices using a point one
should remember, the vertical dots which are nearby so using a pencil we
connect them, it means a lot. How many primes are involved, they are
similar or not, it is an important factor, not what is that prime. Since
the pattern is prime independent, it can happen at many places in the
integer space, this is how a fractal pattern trip-let of triplet of
teardrops could be found in the infinite long integer space. The prime
independent feature gives the fractal nature to the metric. Does it
mean, primes would never have any identity?

The question is answered in .

50% of all integers in the number systems are divisible by 2, every next
number we get by adding 2, starting from 0, the con-tribution of a prime
*P*~1~ to generate integers is *C~P~*~1~ = 1/*P*~1~. The next prime is
not just 1/*P*~2~, but there are numbers, which are products of *P*~1~ ×
*P*~2~. Thus, *P*~2~ makes only *C~P~*~2~ = 1/*P*~2~−1/ (*P*~1~ ×
*P*~2~) addi-tional contributions. Since *P*~2~ is 3, instead of 1/3 \~
33%, deduct-ing the 16% common factors, only 17% of total non-primes is
contributed by 3. Together 2, 3 covers 50% + 17% = 67% of entire integer
space. For P3, the contribution is

that we had to change the resonance chain theory (Ghosh et al., 2014a).
We might sense that we need a large number of primes, a long metric to
explain a complex system, later the theoretical study of vibrations and
pattern of frequencies showed that we need to know only first 12 primes,
up to 47, max (3 primes are silent, else first 15 primes). Each prime,
for example 7, forms a product with other primes say 31 and creates a
series with unique geometric symmetry (7 × 31, 7 × 31 × 2, 7 × 31 × 2 ×
2, and so on). However, only 12 primes could cover 99.99% of all
possible symmetries of the universe. It means 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 ×
17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 37 × 41 × 43 × 47 = 10^12^

number of clocks is enough to create a metric of prime-based hardware
that could spontaneously synchronize with all events happening in
nature. Roughly we have 86 billion neurons in our brain (approximately
10^12^); there are not many neurons to add during evolution of brain.
One could hypothesize that all life forms could be metric of primes. At
the highest level, it starts with a little part of the metric, then we
enter into the singularity points and find tiny slices of the metric. In
a few layers, we could construct architectures of enormous complexity.
Based on the above arguments, the Universe is not a pre-coded machine.
It is self-synthesized by PPM. Everything we see, if we enter inside it
and do not stop our journey, make the motion continuously inside of
whatever we get, it will be a vacuum in most of the places. At the
smallest mass which would appear as solid but when would enter inside,
again, the most part would be empty.

12 primes could reach it to 99.99%, by fitting approximation. We have
plotted the contributions of primes in two compara-tive plots, , the
additional contributions of primes are added as columns, while in we
have made an additional contribution of a given prime in a pi-chart.
Inspired by the pi-chart, we have rotated the horizontal axis of the ,
the bars representing the ordered factor value rotates to form a disk,
if it's a point then a circle and we get a 3D structure as shown in .
While rotating we have kept the contribution of all primes equal,
because that is what an artificial brain is going to do to sense the
universe and respond uniquely.

**No, we do not need a giant metric to sync with the uni-verse: **The
necessity of a giant metric was argued as an essen-tial step to address
the complexity (Zurek, 1989). When Ghosh et al. studied neurons much to
their surprise, they found that firing pattern of neurons cut a slice of
PPM up to 23 (Ghosh, 2016a; see details Chapter 6). The same thing
happened with Sahu et al. when they measured the electromagnetic
resonance pattern of microtubule they found abundance of ratios of peak
frequencies up to 13 (Sahu, 2013a, 2013b). They went on study-ing the
entire brain, many times encountered the number 12,

so on. Now, nature's approach would be top-down spatially, from the
largest boundary of the universe spatially making a journey to the plank
scale. Simultaneously mapping the shortest to the longest time is
possible. A standing waveform is part of a clock (sin or cos wave = a
circle with a rotating system point) and it occupies space, so it is a
unified way to map both space and time. A given number of nodes of a
wave-form is combined until it reaches the prime number of nodes. Then
in a particular way, both time and space are integrated. Therefore, one
gets a composition of frequencies. The num-ber of composition *C *is
plotted as a function of a number of quanta n. A group of primes
determines *C *compositions. *C *− *n *plot shows geometric correlations
of different choices (Harris and Subbarao, 1991; Warlimont, 1993;
Dickau, 1999; Richmond and Knopfmacher, 1995). The *C *− *n *geometric
pattern is called a PPM. Twelve distinct ways one could connect the dots
or events in the PPM. Therefore, there are 12 sub-metrics, or 12
geometric patterns, one top of another. If 12 special methods are
adopted, each pattern is seen. The beauty of PPM is that once a point is
defined, its integration topology is revealed. If it is time, then the
past and the future is also evident. The number of compositions

varies non-linearly with the *N *number of the waveform. The origin of
nonlinearity is the irregular occurrence primes. The prime number of
waveforms has no harmonics, hence, no superposition. Recently, the
fractal metric is suggested to replace the space-time metric (Ord,
1983). PPM shows phase fractal, triplet grouping fractal, phase
quantization, orga-nized selection of clock and anti-clock spin,
circular traps at logarithmic space, a saturation of patterns for 1 = 1
million. **Creation of a PPM: **Total number of harmonics for a positive

we get OF metric, OF(*N*) = HN(*N*) + NC(*N*). The harmonic metric is

Reddy S. et al, converting the architecture into a 3D shape.

engineering challenge for building an artificial brain. The circular

**Derivation of wiring of clocks from 3D PPM: **For this reason, one
rotates the XY plane 360° along the *X*-axis (*X *= *n *or number, *Y *=
*C*, OF, NC, HN). When one connects the

±Y/2 points, using an imaginary line, a 1D line makes a 2D surface.
However, when one rotates the XY plane, an infinite number of the same
imaginary lines in the 2D surface roll. Thus, one gets a 3D structure,
teardrop to ellipsoid, vortex to spiral, and dumbbell disc to nephroid.
As noted above, each

±Y/2 points form a Bloch sphere. As the 2D surface rotates around the
X-axis, the real points of the Bloch sphere rotate

^^*g*/ *^g^^\ ^*^^*g*/\* *h */ *^gh^*

in the metric. Thus, as one connects the C coordinates, by

finding the nearest neighbors as shown in , it is similar to applying
geometric algebra that creates a hyper-space. The process generates
naturally abundant symmetries and dynamics from the pattern of primes. A
slice of PPM designs a universal sensor. PPM inspired sensors would
cap-ture the natural events more efficiently.

Imaginary lines are phase paths connecting the singular-ity points. Once
a singularity point is formed, it triggers a cascade effect. Singularity
acts like glue. It embeds vari-ous time crystals inside or connects side
by side (Pippinger and Fischer, 1979; Gurevich and Shelah, 1989) to the
sur-face of the Bloch sphere. Singularity points are undefined
functions, so Bloch sphere converts into a phase sphere. There are
layers of geometric shapes inside a singularity point. Several clocking
spheres pour in and embed in the host-sphere. Thus, the Phase spheres
expand as it integrates information. It is fractal information theory
(FIT) (Reddy et al., 2018).

**How the PPM hardware is designed and built: **The phi-losophy is that
all information in nature is an event, like a single point, which has a
geometric shape inside with its corners made of sub-events. Following
that philosophy, one has to convert a stream of all sensory signals
(visual, audi-tory etc.) into a time crystal. There are several
self-similar geometric shapes of the time crystal (triangle = 3:2:17).
PPM based filter shrinks the size of a time crystal network. The series
3 × 2 × 17 repeats infinite times in the integer space. The shrunk time
crystal is called a fractal seed. A fractal seed 3 × 2 × 17 means one
could build a rectangle whose corners are triangles 3 × 2 × 17, if we
touch integer 3 × 2 × 17 × 4 = 408. The decision-making core that
repre-sents a PPM would be a 3D time crystal architecture. First, one
should pump such a fractal seed into it. The fractal seed expands by
PPM, morphs into information architecture. During morphogenesis, the
formation of a fractal structure is common in biology (Cooke and Zeeman,
1976). Most dense parts of a time crystal network are blacked out as if
these are pieces of mass. We repeat that in a phase-shift model space,
time and mass are rewritten as a network of clocks mimicking biological
rhythms of a living life form (Frank and Zimmerman, 1969). If these
"masses" are replaced with high-density clocks, phase lines are replaced
with wire, one gets a circuit (see humanoid avatar construction in
Chapter 9). The circuit vibrates like a time crystal. Building a circuit
from the PPM requires ten steps. We discussed the steps below in a
separate section. The experimental pro-totype of the non-computer is a
device whose vibration is similar to a dedicated PPM. There are various
ways to do it. A suitable organic jelly (Ghosh et al., 2014b, 2015b,
2016b) is being developed for over a decade (Chapter 9). Now, a suitable
fourth-circuit element is found (Sahu et al. US pat-ent 9019685B2). It
could be assembled to clock like a PPM (Chapter 8). If electrical white
noise is applied to this hard-ware, then the clocking waveforms
superimpose. It delivers a resonance frequency pattern whose frequency
peak ratios are similar to that of the PPM. With the current technology,
it is not possible to realize a reliable circuitry with intricate

details of PPM. The humanoid avatar built in chapter 9 is primitive but
at least a hope for the future. Moreover, no one requires a new kind of
accurate high-resolution com-puting. The existing Turing based computers
are ultimate in doing that.

**Prototype under construction: **A global platform is under
construction (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2006b; JP-5187804-"a vertical
parallel processor"). In the current prototype of a PPM inspired
humanoid brain, a slice of *N *= 1000 is cut from PPM. One could find
its equivalent clocking circuit, by building an equivalent time crystal
architecture. Depending on the num-ber of integers in the metric,
defines its class. For example, *N *= 1000 means a thousand class
hardware, if *N *= 10^12^, then it is a conscious class or G class
(Figure 10.11, human con-sciousness = G and higher G+, the table in the
Figure 10.12). A G class means a superposition of a pair of time
crystals generated by single hardware (classified). However, a global
triplet of triplet fractal pattern emerges in most of the PPM. If that
seed pattern is plotted in a circle to address the phase quantization,
it makes a wheel for the rotation of 360° phase. This plot is noted as
frequency fractal. Frequency wheel classifies the non-computing ability
in the hardware. It also accounts for a transition from artificial
intelligence to natural intelligence.

When we plot all possible combinations of primes constitut-ing an
integer, e.g., ordered factor, OF metric (); divisor, *D*, or maximum
prime symmetry *S*, as a function of integer, then we get prime
composition metric, PC metric (); when the gap between primes is used as
a key factor in plotting the metric, we get the prime gap or PG met-ric
(). Big data could be fed in all three classes of metrices, we take one
example for simplicity.

Be it a 2D map of spreading a virus in a closed environ-ment, or a
time-lapse satellite image of drying up of a lake, or a 3D map of a
black hole swallowing a supernova, 3D pat-tern electric field pattern on
the human brain, always we see only one thing in a Big Data, how the
most silent and the most active regions are changing. The technology is
patented by Ghosh et al. (Ghosh 2019a, 2019b). Locations of the most
silent points either in the region of highest intensity or the lowest
are points that we count. If three silent points are found and they are
in a ratio 2:5:3, or sometimes, 2:3:5, 5:2:3, 5:3:2, 3:5:2 and 3:2:5,
then we can imagine a hexagon, whose length of arms are relative time
gap between the two events repre-sented here as two ratios. Thus, in the
PPM-S, or S-N plot (**Metric-1**) we can tick *N *= 30 (2 × 3 × 5).
Hexagon is a struc-ture made of phase, neither time, not space. A circle
rotates around its perimeter and bursts energy at six points. If we see
only three combinations out of six in big data, definitely the hexagons
predict the future as it includes other three unknown choices or events
happening beyond that sensor could read. A journey from one corner point
of a hexagon to another is a symmetry breaking. If we add another prime,
say 7 into the

event, we get 2 × 3 × 5 × 7, or 210, and the hexagon could give birth to
three hexagons connected by a line, together they make 24 corners, and
2, 3, 5, 7, four primes could arrange in 24 ways. Then it is not a
symmetry breaking but a phase tran-sition. There could be morphogenesis
where two hexagons connected by a line could transform into a pair of
hexagonal prisms, using the same number of corner points.

For *N *= 300, *S *= 30 and the corresponding peaks are made of 2 × 2 ×
3 × 5 × 5 coupled primes. Now, 2:2:3:5:5 ratio is created by multiple
clocks operating at 1:2, 1:3 and 1:5 ratios. These interactive clocks
change their phase following vari-ous pathways that build the surface of
the phase sphere. Thus, several spheres nest with each other to build
complex crystals. One very interesting feature of converting an image
into a net-work of nested spheres is that a fractal architecture or
dynam-ics is naturally converted into a seed pattern. For example, for
*N *= 300, when we get 2:2:3:5:5, it could shrink a mas-sive fractal
architecture. Imagine we have a host sphere with two guests A1, A2, (1 ×
2) each has two guests, B1, B2, B3, B4 (1 × 2 × 4). Each B has 3 guest
spheres, C1, C2, C3... C10, C11, C12. Each C has 5 guests. D1, D2, D3
... D57, D58,

D59, D60. Each D has 5 guest spheres, E1, E2, E3 ... E297, E298, E299,
E300. Thus, 300 + 60 + 12 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 379

clocks running in a fractal network would be replaced by five spheres,
one for each layer A, B, C, D, E. Thus, fractal shrinks a complex
dynamic system as a time crystal form in GML. The GML is a language of
nature analogous to the machine language of computers.

1.  **METRIC 1: AN INTEGER IS REPLACED BY A TYPICAL GEOMETRIC SHAPE**

Below is a summary of ten distinct classes of PPM essential to operate
together for making a reliable and comprehensive decision. The first
type of PPM links an integer with a geo-metric shape, as described
above.

**How to calculate *S** *for an S-N plot: **The new parame-ter *S *is
not an ordered factor or factor or divisor commonly used in mathematics.
An integer is a product of primes *N *= *a^p^^\ ^*× *b^q^^\ ^*× *c^r^*,
(300 = 2^2\ ^3 5^2^). How many primes do we have? *C *= *p *+ *q *+ *r*,
i.e., 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. We can arrange these primes in *D *= (*p *+ 1) \*
(*q *+ 1) \* (*r *+ 1) ways. For 300, we

get for *N *= 300, *D *= (2 + 1) \* (1 + 1) \* (2 + 1) = 18. Here *D*

is the number of factors or divisors. For 300, the numbers 10, 12, 15,
20, 25, 30, all are divisors. We take only the ordered factor made of
primes to build an S-N plot, PPM-S. So, for 300, we get 30 combinations
of 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 5, i.e., *S *= 30.

For 300, the constituent primes are 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, we calculate

all 30 possible distinct symmetries like 2:2:3:5:5, 3:5:5:2:2, 5:2:2:3:5
etc in a data and position all 30 of them at the cor-ners of a geometric
shape with 30 vertices (*S *= 30). The ratio of primes can have
constellations, for example, here 2:2:3:5:5 can have several similar
ratios of primes, like 13:13:17:23:23, 37:37:43:47:47. They create an
infinite series by writing an impression in the integer space, that is
why no sensor-detected geometry is pure, but a repetition of the ratio
of prime's infi-nite series.

Let's take another example as shown in . Say, we have 12. Its 8 ordered
factors are 2 × 6, 6 × 2, 3 × 4, 4 × 3,

2 × 2 × 3, 2 × 3 × 2, 3 × 2 × 2, 1 × 12, but we take only

3 of 8, they are 2 × 2 × 3, 2 × 3 × 2, 3 × 2 × 2, hence *S *= 3 (--).
Thus, S-N is a topological function. From ordered factor, OF, we simply
remove non-prime terms to get *S*. Easy way to calculate *S *is to find
the permutation of *C *and divide it with permutations of all repeating
primes.

^For\ 300,\ ^*^Q^^\ ^*^\ 3!-\ ^^0!\ ^*^v^*^0!^^1.\ and\ for\ 12,\ ^*^Q^^\ ^*^1!-\ 0!\ 1.\ For\ read-^

ers 3! 3*v*2*v*1*v*0*v*/. In principle, all possible symmetries of

the real world are hidden in some integer of the number sys-tem, we map
it using an S-N plot as shown in e, this is the basic PPM-S. It is
different from the OF(*N*) plot shown in . The hidden topologies of
primes shown in bind the isolated patterns or shapes drawn in the SN
plot of . SN plot is called prime composition or PC metric.

**Every single prime has a geometric shape, so a few shapes could
generate 99.99**% **of all integers: **Every single value of *S *is
assigned to a geometry, check the list of primes with the specific
geometric shapes as shown in the . Say, in a rapidly changing big data,
we find that the integer representing the dynamics of the database is
changing from 140 to 144. At 140, we get the number of ordered prime
factor = the number of vertices = *S *= 12, i.e., a hexagonal prism.
Then for 141, we get a line (*S *= 2), so, the symmetry breaks. However,
for 142, 143 the line remains (*S *= 2), as the number of divisors for
all three num-bers is two, the symmetry is intact. At 144, again, the
sym-metry breaks, and we get 15 vertices or divisors (*S *= 15), which
could be three square pyramids arranged in a trian-gular shape (5 × 3 =
15). Change in integer could trigger a phase transition. In , we have
shown how to write number 30 using geometric shapes and made it to 180
by geometrically multiplying 30 × 6. Therefore, the prime composition
metric shown in is also shown in which explains the prime geometric
significance of every single integer. All versions of PPM including OF
metric and prime gap or PG metric would have a similar geometric
representation, though we have not discussed it further.

**A fusion of several geometries one inside another: A precursor to time
crystal: ***S *= 1, refers to a dimension-less point, *S *= 2 signifies
a line, *S *= 3 to 6 we get 2D shapes and for *S *= 7 to 20 we get 3D
shapes. If sensors get the value of *S *that is not defined by GML then
we combine the geom-etries so that the total number of corner points of
all par-ticipatory geometries is *S*. Here we give two examples. If we
get *S *= 8, we do not opt for the 2D octagon, the largest 2D shape
allowed is a hexagon, we stick to that, and adopt a 3D shape, a cube or
a square pyramid. Since the largest 3D shape is dodecahedron (20
vertices, we get 20, for integer *N *= 120 for the first time), for
integer *N *= 180, we get *S *= 30, since we can write 30 = 3 × 10, and
pentagonal prism has 10 verti-ces, we can draw a triangle, its each
corner point would have a pentagonal prism. Together, the triangular
arrangement of three prisms provides 30 vertices. The composition of a
new

architecture or dodecahedron.

geometric shape by inserting one geometric form into another follows a
rule, we start with a point i.e., 0D, put 1D shapes insides then put 2D
shapes inside. Inside the 2D shapes, we put the 3D shapes.

1.  **METRIC 2: PRODUCT OF PRIMES FORMING INTEGERS LED TO A UNIQUE
    ORDERED FACTOR METRIC**

Even within the domain of Metric 2, we now discuss one of the most
important aspects of PPM, projection from infinity. Currently in , the
projection and feedback are dis-cussed only for OF metrics described in
. However, a similar discussion could be carried out for SN or prime
com-position, PC metric () or prime gap or PG metric ().

**Projection from infinity: **When Ramanujan showed that the sum of
integers is −1/12, many people ignored it as fun. However, several
people went ahead and started seeing how the arrangement of integers
could project an entirely new perspective to the infinity, which returns
an unbelievable value. Here in this book, any chapter we open, we would
find

from the darkest corner inside a protein to the mathematics of primes to
nature's 1.5 million years of a nearly perfect decision-making machine
called the human brain, 12 is out there. 12 triplet of triplet resonance
band builds a human brain (Chapter 7). Now, return to the Ramanujan's
derivation, look at it again, why that 12? Is it an accident? No. Do a
little math and we would find there are only 12 projections to infinity
and one of them is returned from infinity, that's what negative sign
refers to. It is exactly similar to the fourth-circuit element we have
explained in Chapter 8 where we have explored a new kind of phase space,
with 12 holes or singularities, projec-tion through that mask creates
the composition of vortex atom assembly. That composition of vortex
atoms is also the foun-dation of the GML. Now, by counting the number of
divisors and ordering them we built a 2D and 3D pattern in , however,
can we use the Ramanujan's mathematical trick and apply that on the
geometric pattern?

If mathematics is about playing with numbers, and geo-metric shapes, why
not project the metric to infinity follow-ing Ramanujan's way and have
fun. That's is exactly what we have compiled in . Here we take all
primes but only the product of particular primes along the horizontal

**FIGURE 3.4 **PPM-2 is codenamed as symmetry ratio of primes. Here a
table is presented with 14 integers and its corresponding metric shapes.
The table has two parts one in the left and one to its right. Each part
contains three information column-wise. First, is the prime number,
second is metric and the third is the basic geometric pattern that gets
repeated over the integer space. Note that if *X *and *Y *axes boundary
values are changed then the pattern also changes. When we consider an
integer and continuously take its products, say the starting integer is
2 and we take the products of 2 as 2*n*, *n *= 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So,
for 19 the integers to be considered in the horizontal *X*-axis would be
19, 38, 57, 76... For these integers, the corresponding ordered factors
OF are calculated and plotted on the vertical axis with ± OF/2. Then the
nearest neighbors are connected in a 2D loop. A composition of these
loops becomes a PPM. In this way, if a particular prime dominates
statistically, then there is a probability that the metric corresponding
to that particular integer is dominating in the system.

axis, the vertical axis remains the same, and the ordered fac-tors are
connected to build the geometric shape. Now, if just like Ramanujan,
instead of all patterns, reject the uncommon loops between the
neighboring domains and see which pat-tern survives until *N *= 500. We
do not have to go to infinity, but the projection to infinity is
visible, it is named as fractal seed. It is a seed geometry and its
importance is enormous in the construction of a Fractal tape, what that
comes from infin-ity is never defined, one of 12 possible choices
return, though only one option is shown here. Projection from infinity
to the reality is not mysterious, it is like 11 imaginary worlds are
redefining the reality with a choice not logically feasible, but
mathematically perceivable.

Projection from infinity is not limited to the PPM, in the , we have
plotted a table listing the ten physical phe-nomena outlined in this
book where artificial brain engineer-ing would harvest infinity and make
sure that Ramanujan's negative feedback of number system is explored.
Another ver-sion of the same table is to be found in Figure 4.14, where
one could sense how the typical mechanics of 11 imaginary worlds make
sure that projection from infinity redefines real-ity. Thus, a
projection from infinity is a change in reality, due to the combination
of options, which is projected to infinity and feedback is sent. To an
engineer, if implemented in the hardware, this would be an
auto-evaluation program.

## **The second type of PPM metric accounts for the scale-free geometric shapes or fractals (PPM-F): **Each prime is

associated with a particular seed geometry, that repeats con-tinuously
in the PPM. A tubulin protein uses only a few inte-gers, which means
only a few primes, so is microtubule and, so is the neuron.
Bio-engineering is all about "bandwidth of primes." Since we limit
ourselves within a maximum *N *that is the product of the first 12
primes *N~max~ *= 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 ×

17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 37, we explore only 230 million primes within
*N *= 10^12^. Thus, each of the 12 patterns of 12 primes is edited by
230 million primes. A seed geometry expands fractally, over the entire
integer space. Here we provide 12 geometric seeds that cover 99.99%
integer space.

Prime 2 triggers the formation of crossing parallel lines into a
rhombus. Its lowest integer holds another rhombus, and this fractal
feature continues. Similarly, triplets expand fractally, the first loop
of a teardrop-like a triplet in the PPM contains another similar
triplet, we call it triplet of the triplet. Prime 5 builds S-shaped
open-end curves. Prime 7 embeds the circles in the curves. Together
prime 5 and prime 7 cre-ates a fractal of flower pot repeated over the
entire integer space. Prime 11 builds a fractal of reverse petals; Prime
13 builds a fractal of hearts Prime 17 builds a fractal of spiral Prime
19 builds a fractal of spiral; Prime 23 builds a fractal of vortex Prime
29 builds a fractal of toroid Prime 31 builds a fractal of crossed
petals Prime 37 builds a fractal of par-allel lines. In the PPM-S, which
structure would they prefer during the integration of neighboring
integers is decided by fractal metric PPM-F. To make sense brain may
predict future

(Nieuwland et al., 2018); for PPM-hardware, in the metric that maps
past-present-future of an event, as soon as the space for "present" is
filled up, the infinite series of future events is redefined.

1.  **METRIC 3: INTEGERS LIMITED TO**

**360**° **PHASE BUILD CLOCKWISE AND ANTICLOCKWISE PATHS**

**The third type of PPM-LK covers the effect on phase and dynamics
**when a particular slice is cut from a PPM-P, by selecting an integer.
When we select an integer, phase varies uniquely for the structures of
all integers below. We need an intricate map for three reasons. (a)
Setting the critical spatial and angular parameters of geometric shape
for a given number of vertices. (b) Identifying the rotational direction
of clocks, the relative phase difference between clocks and finding how
do the directions change. A change in the clocking direction maps the
inherent dynamics of an unknown system. (c) When we link the two active
integers in the PPM, the silent integers in between providing the key
linking geometries. However, we need strictly defined mathematical rules
to use those shapes to link the neighboring geometric shapes. Molecular

left-right (LR) asymmetry leads to whole-cell LR asymmetry (Wood and
Kershaw, 1991), here we see the numerical ori-gin of LR asymmetry, a key
to engineer morphogenesis in a life form (Pearson and Winey, 2009). For
these reasons, we have introduced **three "phase" versions of PPM**,
namely PPM-LK (5). Three PPMs map how between a pair of selected
integers, the starting phase of the structures var-ies from 0° to 360°.
The relative phase of all the structures is meticulously defined.

The first metric identifies a set of integers form a local group
preferring a clockwise or anticlockwise rotation. Means, say if we
select *N *= 12, we cut the ordered factor metric a slice of length 12.
The journey from 12 to 1 is divided into 360° angular distributions. In
the polar plot, each of the 12 integers constitutes a radial line. So,
radial line for 1 dif-fers from the line for 2 by 360/12 = 30°, the
distance from center is the value of number of divisors, *D *or ordered
factor, OF; or prime symmetry, *S*. The phase plot connecting *D *or OF
or *S*, depicts a pair of clockwise and then a pair of anti-clockwise
rotating lines, globally form a lotus flower. It is a very significant
discovery. It means a set of integers would favor a clockwise or
anticlockwise rotation when they would link to an external pattern. A
pair of limiting integers reach

integer and *r *is the ordered factor. Say we want to plot *N *= 30,
then we create an imaginary circle where each integer is separated by
12° and for each angle we move outward radially, since the distance from
center would measure the ordered factor. In the bottom part of the panel
we have shown a schematic showing clockwise and anticlockwise rotation
of the minimum distance lines created by connecting the ordered factor

an equilibrium, form a petal. Since the layers of petals move radially
outward, it promotes self-assembly within and above. Thus, when we
choose an integer, it makes a slice in PPM-LK from 0 to *N*, that
slicing naturally defines its dynamics and the self-assembly properties.

we find that by *N *= 1 million, the slop curve traces a circle. The
saturation means, new patterns that could connect the *N *= 0 point all
the way to the front would not be a new one, it would almost retrace the
tear-drop or other loops created by smaller numbers. When system
retraces the previous plot with a little or no change, it means, there
would be no new feedback from infinity as shown in .

We argued above that the product of the first 12 primes is around
10^11^. Since we limit ourselves within a maximum *N *that is the
product of the first 12 primes *N~max~ *= 2 × 3 × 5 × 7

× 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 37 = 7.42 × 10^12\ ^Here

only 12 primes are taken because the early occurring primes in the
integer space leaves its signature the most on the entire integer space
to follow. The total contribution for a prime is

\~100/prime, hence integer 2 occurs 50% in all possible natu-ral
numbers. The total contribution is not what we want. If we record the
original contribution of a prime in addition to the contribution made by
the previous primes over the inte-ger space, we find that only 12 primes
contribute to 99.99%.

**FIGURE 3.6 **Two classes of PPM are presented here. PPM-4 describes
the relative increment of the ordered factor with respect to the integer
(panel a, b and c). To the right, panel d explains the PPM-6. The polar
plot of ordered factor vs integer *N *shows that certain points appear
empty, white spots. These empty points form a pattern. (a) Two schematic
cylinders whose diameters are *N *and lengths are the ordered factor.
Two cylinders are for *N *= 1000 and *N *= 10000000. (b) *N *= 0, *N *=
*n *and ordered factor OF forms a triangle. Its slope is plotted with
the integer, the value reaches to 90°. (c) The change in the shape of
the plot shown in panel (a) is gene ralized in the panel (c). The slope
of OF with N when reaches 90°, this means the line that forms a slope is
a tangent, the phase plot looks like a circle. Product of 12 primes
reaches a thousand billion, once C2, C3...C37...C47 symmetries cover
99.99% (12 to 15 primes does not make much difference). Panel

\(c\) demonstrates that once 99.99% is reached the resultant number
around 7.42 × 10^12^, that is not a fixed number, but that final number
is considered 1 and a new plot begins. Four times the process is
repeated. (d) Polar plot of OF, for *N *= 10^9^, period *N *= 360. The
new cycle begins at 361 and then again at 721, etc. Here, all OF points
are connected by line. We get a gap. These gaps make circles.

Thus, *N *= 10^11\ ^or *N *= 10^12\ ^limits are not accidental. There is
no strict limit, but if we go beyond, new primes above 47 or 53 hardly
make a significant contribution to the symme-try breaking, or they do
not regulate events statistically. It is better to build a
decision-making system made of 10^11\ ^or 10^12\ ^clocks as a single
clock and start recounting *N *= 0, 1, 2,

... 10^11^, time and again. We convert various one-dimensional
parameters of integer space into a 3D architecture by rotat-ing a 2D
plot by 360°. Always, the PPM actually clocks in nature (PPM-P), in a
cycle between 1 and 10^11^.

1.  **METRIC 5: WHEN ORDERED FACTOR IS MUCH GREATER THAN THE INTEGER**

**The fifth type of metric considers the differential factor between two
types of matrices**, PPM-D. In the first route, using a 360° rotation of
36 planes, one for each integer between 1 to 37, each pair of planes
separated by a 10° gap, we can convert any 2D PPM into a 3D PPM. In the
second route, we set the contribution of a prime as its angular
separation, say 2 means 50°, because it occurs 50% times, 3 means 16°,

because 3 occurs additional 16% in the entire integer space, and so on
until we reach a total of 100°. Then we increase each prime's angular
gap so that total angular distribution is 360° for first 12 primes.
These two routes are primarily used to generate the 3D PPM. Above, we
explained that each prime starts generating its own fractal geometry in
the PPM, it means above *N *= 37 the 12th prime, at some integer *N*, we
would find that ordering of primes would generate geometries unrelated
to the pattern of any particular prime (ordered factor, OF). That
integer is *N *= 48, OF = 48, above this point we start seeing OF \>\>
*N*, i.e., ordering of numbers (e.g., 2 × 3 and 3 × 2) factor so much
that the values of integer *N *or divisor *D *do not matter. For OF \>\>
*N*, the grouping of sets of primes or nesting of geometries regulate
the properties; higher-level geometries lose all key geometric feature
that primes used to generate in the PPM as shown in the . In the 3D plot
of OF-*N*, we remove the 3D part OF \< *N*, thus, we get an annular 3D
architecture, which reflects how groups of primes form higher-level
topologies. shows another jour-ney of the annular metric from *N *=
400,000 to 40,000. It is a new metric which links distinct geometries
that creates

front part of the OF plot is zoomed below for all cases. Triplet of

schematic of the fractal is shown in the top-right sub-panel. (b) All
the values below OF \< *N *are deleted, so that a unique set of pattern
is visible. One could compare the plots in Panel (a) and the panel (b).

virtual corner points more than the number of singularities. It is a
remarkable map because it accounts for the superpo-sition of geometric
shapes and dynamics that systems with apparent self-similarity could not
fathom. The differential PPM is a particular class and we can choose any
two param-eters to build a similar annular metric that accounts for the
3D evolution of a typical functional parameter.

The triplet of triplet fractal features of this annular metric is shown
in a. If one continuously zooms the metric as shown in the left column
of the plot, the smallest triplet of trip-lets is reached, at *N *= 12.
If one compares the figures zoomed at different intervals, one of the
three teardrops, the patterns are never self-similar, but globally
always triplet of triplet. Therefore, whether to call it a fractal or
not is a big confusion. In we explain the musical string analogy of the
ordered factor OF and in we explain the coffee cup analogy of ordered
factor OF. While shows that coffee cup = cycloid = teardrop of OF, the
shows that even classical strings (choice 7,8) would show a continued
fraction of nesting clocks as described in Chapter 2.

1.  **METRIC 6: EMPTY SPACE IN THE PLOT OF ORDERING OF DIVISORS IN PHASE
    PLOT PRESENTS HOLES**

The sixth metric described in the is the same polar plot of phase
described above for metric 3, clocking fea-tures, but we notice that no
line connecting the *S*, OF, and *D *values pass through particular
points. When the maximum *N *increases and we connect the OF, CN, SN or
NC values, there are empty places found when we connect the value points
in the polar plot using lines. The missing points in the phase-OF plot
show that empty points are not randomly distributed. Empty or silent
points are invisible points of attractor when *N *increases. The silent
points in the phase plot described above where no *S*, OF, or *D *values
are found; these silent points arrange in *c*^0^ ** ^0^ ** ^0^,
thus, a global phase regulation exists over the entire integer space.
Thus, we get three fundamen-tal constants regulating the clocking
direction by creating null points. The non-existent features in the
**PPM explores the possibility of integrating infinite mathematical
series **using geometric algebra; we call it continued fraction
geo-metric algebra, CFGA. Here, the circles are looped intricately one
inside another; the diameters are such that they generate infinite
series for e, π, and Φ. Often we build a new calculator where one draws
only circles but solves complex mathemat-ics, even simple arithmetic, or
algebra. Then we monitor the

major structural changes around the peak, *N *** &*L
*\'-*^[\ ]{.underline}^^[L]{.underline}^^[\ ]{.underline}^^\ ^*^\ ^as

expected. The density of primes nonlinear features triggers

major structural phase transitions. We noticed that the location of the
peak is related to a pair of primes, prime1 × 10^±prime2^. Thus, the
sudden non-linear changes in the density of primes generate a constant
to estimate a major change in the geomet-ric structure. These constants
appear similar to the universal constants we find in nature. When the
events are converted into geometric structures, and if the pattern of
primes governs

the evolution of events, then the sudden turbulences are expected if
such topological conditions. These topological constraints even regulate
the dynamics of events at all levels above a sudden peak point.

1.  **METRIC 7: STATISTICAL DOMINANCE OF PRIMES IN THE INTEGER
    SPACE---SILENT AND ACTIVE PRIMES**

**The Seventh type of PPM, PL PPM explore the effect of the non-linear
distribution of primes below 10^12^: **The gap between the neighboring
primes is an interesting twist in the GML-PPM-H triad computing. If the
gap is two, it is called paired prime, the gap is six, sexy primes and
so on. shows the maximum gap of neighboring primes, which increases with
the integer. Primes are null points, silence in the language of nature
but they shape the pattern, 2 × 3 and 2 × 47 have the same horizontal
axis in any version of the PPM plot.

Normalized distribution of primes tells us how prime distri-bution
differs from a particular function that supposed to pre-dict the density
of primes. We have plotted a very well known data the density of primes

over the integral space as shown in

non-linear regions of prime distribution in the integer space,

which is below *N *= 10^12^. Above the limiting *N*, the prime den-sity
does not change in an unpredictable manner, i.e., follows

** &*L *\' function as is. Below that limit, the sudden peaks and

dips in the P-N plot depict the structural phase transitions in the time
crystals. Why is this plot so important? When we look at a fractal, even
if you expand it to infinity, a simple pattern repeats, therefore,
information content is null, irrespective of its size. Now, when a
single function draws the baseline and with respect to its variation we
measure the prime density dis-tribution, we find exactly the change from
predictable density. That estimation of non-predictability would also be
reflected when the PPM would change the geometric shapes during
decision-making. Thus, shows two distinct con-firmations that beyond a
limiting integer, the primes would not bring unpredictable changes to
the output.

shows the sum of prime factors, SOPF, which is a unique metric created
by taking prime factors like , PC metric, but with a twist. Prime
factors are added and to implement C2 symmetry, divided by two. The plot
shows a nearly periodic ripple and as the number increases, we find more
and more ripples are born along a virtual axis. An integer is a product
of primes that delivers OF metric, PC metric and PG metric. However, the
addition of those primes for integers follow superposition of diverg-ing
waves in a regular increment of its periodicity. It makes the metric
beautiful. To find the origin of this spontaneous rhythmic behavior, we
dug deeper, looked into the spiral plot of primes, which is quite
popular among mathematicians who want to find a hidden rule of nature
coding the primes in the plots and . Serious mathematicians and

**FIGURE 3.8 **Seventh class of PPM deals with the features of primes
which make some of them statistically dominating or silent when we count
them in a limit of integers. (a) The prime gap is plotted against the
integer *N *for *N *= 10^18^. (b) Graph showing the ratio of the
prime-counting function *π*(*x*) to two of its approximations, *x*/ln *x
*and Li(*x*). As *x *increases (note *x*-axis is logarithmic), both
ratios tend towards 1. The ratio for *x*/ln *x *converges from above
very slowly, while the ratio for Li(*x*) converges more quickly from
below (Wiki, free commons).

\(c\) An integer is made of primes, its factor primes if added shows
ripples. We plotted ±SOPF/2 vs N. Panels (d) and (e) show spiral plots
of integers and primes, often such plots are used to find the pattern of
primes. The starting pattern and the worldlines connecting the similar
values in the plots are governing factors. (f) We count the number of
times a given set of primes are used while creating integers up to *N*.
Here all primes are counted up to *N *= 174000. One could see that the
peak *P *is at prime 47. Normally, we expect 50% of all factors should
be 2, so it should be a decreasing plot with the maximum value at 2. But
we find here that has a modal distribution that is increasing at a slow
rate approximating the cube root of *N*. Up to 10,000, this mode is 19.
Up to 1,000,000, this mode is 73. For any given set of numbers, there
will be a distinctive peak near *P *\^ 3 = *N*. (g) The plot (f) is
zoomed in the panel (g) left and ripples of statistical dominance and
silence of the primes are shown schematically in the panel (i) and the
entire series of events is summarized as colored balls in the panel (h).

around the perimeter. The red balls are statistically second position
and blue balls depict the third position. Silent primes are also noted
in the panel.

topologists do not care that at the center of these plots lie a geometry
and always that is a triangle, who started it we do not know but if we
change that the connected worldline would change, and even in spite of
that a pseudo-periodicity in den-sity distribution is apparent.

Finally for the density of prime metric discussion we arrive at the most
exciting part, the story of silent and active primes. In the mathematics
literature there is no mention of such a phenomenon of the primes ( and
). This is quite well known and studied by a large number of
mathematicians is that how many times the primes occur within a given
inte-ger limit? One could write a simple code, finding prime fac-tors is
easy, simply count them and plot against the primes. is one such plot,
which suggests that there is a peak around 70--80, the point shifts but
very slowly as the

number increases rapidly. The feature is popular, but when we dig deeper
we find that during counting some primes never dominate the statistical
occurrence. That makes them silent all around. In the central plot of
the bottom row in , we have created statistics, how this phenomenon
unfolds. Until 30, 3 dominates, until 500, 7 and so on. We have plot-ted
up to 53 because we are interested only around 12 active primes and that
story completes within 170,000. That is not a big number. In fact, above
12 or 15 primes, the statistical fluc-tuation of which prime dominates
the prime factor of integer, saturates. It means a clear answer to the
big data generation or to the spontaneous organic synthesis of brain
jelly, even if one begins with a soup of random H devices, the
composition of statistically dominating primes would take over the
dynamics as plotted in the .

    IN EVENTS**

**Prime operator 8, namely PN, Normalized ripples: **-- is a journey to
see all above metrics discussed above by normalizing the values to one.
Irrespective of the nature of the metric or their foundation, when we
consider that maximum choices are one, a new pattern emerges. Here we
would discuss only the OF metric, i.e., normalize in a step-by-step
process. If we do not look into the *C*2 sym-metry, which means do not
divide OF by 2, we get a plot like , ripples are there, but it is
expressed more when in , it is divided by 2. We have enlarged the ripple
of the panel a in panel c so that one could compare it with the
normalized plot of OF metric in . Here we write OF = *C*(*H*) in honor
of Ray Tomes.

**The mathematical kernels for the escape time frac-tal tape network:
Ordered factorization: **Let us consider that fractal tape
machine/network is represented by a single wave function *^^*^\ ^which
includes the observer too. Now, if we include boundary conditions, **
represents one tape, but inside it could be two tapes or two
wavefunctions, **  0** ~0~\* in gen-eral **  *l* *~l~*, now, for
some n, there could be more waveforms inside, e.g., for *n *= 4, ** 
2** ~2~\* **  0** ~0~\* two possibilities

^are\ there.\ For\ ^*^n^^\ ^*^=\ 8,\ ^*^^*^\ \ 6^*^^*^\ ^~^6^~, ** 

the part 0**~2~ could be made using 4 small

** ~2~ parts, or 2 numbers of ** ~0~ parts. Thus, for *n *= 8 there
are three ways energy could transfer from point A to B (C(H)\~3).
Probability of some harmonics to occur is more than others in the
fractal tape network. Let's take another example, *n *= 12,

** /0**~/0~\* **  1** ~2~\* **  2** ~1~\* **  0** ~4~\* **
 4** ~0~\* now again,

**  1** ~2~ can happen in two ways as earlier, and **  0** ~4~ can
happen in three ways. Thus, *n *= 12 harmonics can get energy 8 ways
(C(H)\~8).

However, for *n *= 5, 17, 13 only one way (C(H)\~1). Now if we make a
journey from *n *= 1 to *n *= 10^53^, we find that for *n *= 2, 4, 24,
36, 72, 96 the same tape can have a large number of cells C(H), each
cell is identical by energy but structurally and information-wise
distinct. Now, as n increases, or we make a transverse journey through
the tapes, energy could decay 1/H, or 1/H^2\ ^etc, then we find C(H)/H
or power distribution across harmonics, remains nearly constant over n.
C(H)/H vary with n as a local Gaussian-like function, first increases
with 2*^n^^\ ^*and then decreases, again increases with 2*^n^*3^1^,
again decreases, then it goes on and on 2*^n^*3*^r^*5*^k^*.... In *n *=
10^53\ ^scale of harmonics, just after 5 is encountered, there is a
primary peak in C(H)/H, and just after 3 is encountered there is a
secondary peak in C(H)/H, overall, it is a nearly periodic oscillation
of power distribution over n harmonics, in Log scale (0 to 53), the
period is \~4.5

every single object in this universe generates sym-metry following the
harmonics relationship.

**T**he integers with similar OF, *D *or *S *form a wave-like link over
the entire integer space, irrespective of the primes they are made of
(). The ripples depict an ordered flow of higher and lower values of OF,
*D *or *S*, the ripple wave either converges or diverges as the numbers
increase. The path mapped by the ripples connect integers which have a
nearly similar shape, a gradual change in shape is a map of symme-try
breaking when there is a large change in a waveform, we call it phase
transition. One example of a phase transition or crossover is shown in
the panel , where two distinct starting group of primes engage in a
predictable crossover.

Then we plot three types of phase parameters along three axes in a 3D
phase variation as it is practiced in the time crys-tal analysis as
shown in f. For the first phase param-eter *P*, we consider *N *=
10^12\ ^points as 360°, since the hardware counts an object with
10^12\ ^clocks as a single clock and restarts counting from *N *= 1.
Now, for the second phase parameter, we plot the slope between the
ordered factor and its correspond-ing integer, which tends to reach 90°,
which is maximum. So, we consider 90° as the maximum phase 360° and the
slope becomes the second phase parameter. The third phase param-eter is
a contribution of 12 primes, total contribution 100 is considered as
360° and angular width of each prime is its

occupancy in the integral space. These three-phase values are plotted
along three orthogonal axes to create a 3D phase architecture
representing the most dynamic part of prime density distribution,
similar to the time crystal (PPM-L).

1.  **METRIC 9: LATTICE GROUP OF PRIMES (TWIN PRIMES, COUSIN PRIMES,**

**CO-PRIMES, AND GAUSSIAN PRIMES)**

**The ninth type of PPM explores building lattice struc-tures **(PPM-G)
using the gap between the primes. The gaps form groups (tuples), if *k
*gaps form a group, it repeats over the infinite integer space as
*k*-tuples. Every occurrence of *k*-tuples means a certain geometric
feature would repeat in the PPM which would bond the isolated and
discrete geomet-ric shapes of associated integers into a common
geometric shape. The general tendency of gaps between adjacent primes to
become larger as the numbers themselves get larger. However, the plot of
the frequency of particular gap between a pair of primes varies in an
oscillatory manner over the integer space, the peaks are always at
multiples of 6 (Ares and Castro, 2006). Since 6 = 3 × 2, we plotted PPM
only for the integers which are multiples of 2 or 3, and PPM-L
trans-formed into an infinite chain of circles or spheres, thus,
clock-ing is inherently embedded in the frequency of prime gaps as shown
in the . Sexy prime doublets, (5,11), (7,13),

**FIGURE 3.10 **The ninth class of PPM is about grouping of different
prime numbers. Panel (a) shows that prime gap is plotted against the
integers or primes. However, one could plot Gaussian primes or Co-primes
too to get another group of PPMs. A part of the metric shown in panel
(a) is zoomed in the panel (b). Both panels (a) and (b) plots
Pythagorean primes (green) and the rest of the primes (red). The
existence of twin primes, (prime numbers separated by 2), Cousin primes
(primes separated by 4), sexy primes (primes separated by 6), and even
triplets and quadruplets of primes. Recently, it has been demonstrated
that there exist arbitrary large arithmetic progressions of primes
(Terence Tao). It is evident that these groups of primes, or
constellations, emerge naturally because the whole prime structure has
no evidence of certain order, it has no series expansion, and has no
symmetry. (c) Fibonacci primes (blue) and ordered factor of all integers
that are product of 24 are plotted here. A part of the metric is zoomed
in the panel (d). Panel (e) shows co-primes or mutually prime number for
example 1,2, or 4,5,6, where there are no divisors except 1 between
then. The first node (2,1) is marked red, its three children are shown
in orange, third generation is yellow, and so on in the rainbow order.
Triplet of groups is noted. (f) Gaussian prime and the Eisenstein primes
are plotted. Note that the primes processed by quaternion, octonion and
dodecanions are all generic versions of Gaussian primes where not one
but multiple imaginary vectors reside.

when we plot Pythagorean primes and zoom a small part of . The question
is how the circular feature origi-

it is called a Gaussian prime, e.g., 5, 13, 17, 29 (Pratt, 1975). If the
condition is not satisfied, then non-Gaussian, e.g., 3, 7, 11, 19, 23,
31 etc. For a Gaussian prime, the eight corresponding divisors are
located on a complex circle or sphere. Thus, in the sexy prime tuplets,
if we have one or more Gaussian prime we get the 4  1*v*0 feature of
generating a clocking phase (i) is activated in the PPM-G.

In , we have plotted both OF and the prime gap for Fibonacci primes side
by side and zoomed it in to compare how at the very core region they
match. This plot is important since Hasse diagram that we would discuss
in Chapter 9, governing the energy transmission the PPMs, run on
Fibonacci primes primarily. Addition of primes is a very classical way
of energy transfer, while the product is a quan-tum way, we discovered
this in the proteins and implemented it in designing the fourth-circuit
element's governing func-tion that regulates the blinking of 12
singularities. During energy transfer, primes act in a group and then
co-primes act as coherent entities, however, even in that group we find
the triplet of triplets as shown in . Normalized polar plots of the
distribution of primes create wheels, mostly such plots as shown in are
drawn for fun, but, here, when the pattern of primes govern organic
synthesis and that synthesis is the brain jelly, making decisions, the
wheels are all regulators of periodicity that would unfold in the
complex-ity of the Big Data.

to a higher dimension. In 1919, inspired by Einstein, Theodore Kaluza
thought if by using 4D, Einstein could explain gravity, then why not
take 5D and include electromagnetic field. The problem was where to keep
the 5D elements? In 1926, Oskar Klein suggested put-ting the tiny
spheres (10^−30\ ^cm) of 5D on every point on the 4D space-time
structure, we can't see them because the size is small (10^−8\ ^cm is
the diameter of H atom). In the 1960s, when more forces were introduced,
e.g., strong and weak interactions, to integrate, five new dimensions
were proposed. In the 1990s, Ed Witten came to a truce, he reduced all
pos-sible dimensions to only 11 (M-theory). We extrapolated Kaluza'a
idea, insert the entity of a higher dimension inside every pixel of a
lower-dimensional entity. However, there is a major difference between
GML and Kaluza's proposition. While Kaluza and their followers
transformed every single pixel of a lower dimension with an entity of a
higher dimen-sion, we suggest looking only into the singularity point of
a lower dimension entity.

Tenth class PPM metric implements the concept of a higher dimension,
where the sum of primes could build a modulo and regulate the multiple
prime sums as alternate solutions (). We always transform an acquired
input, a point to a 3D sphere, a line to a 3D cylinder and a 2D square
to a cube, thus, the starting geometry is always a 3D shape. With
learning, the 3D shape morphs to mimic the input data structure
\[subject-clause-(verb-adjective)\]. If we see a cat from one side, C2
symmetry is applied and the other invisible half is created as a mirror
reflection. Similarly, we search for C5, C7...C47 symmetries in the data
and by applying each symmetry we regenerate missing parts. It does not
end there. We create an infinite series of 3D structure dynamics using
PPM incorporating higher dimensions as the higher-order terms. A cat has
now infinite replicas doing different things. Thus, even for a given
point, the true input is a sphere vibrat-ing at 11 distinct dynamics
embedded at 12 layers one inside another. The different quaternion
regions in the dodecanion () and octonion tensors representing the group
of singularity points No input data is static, no geometric struc-ture
is kept at one fixed dimension, ever, it is always a series of events.
Seeing a cat means adopting all possible dynam-ics of a cat, not just
physical, but all higher-level control and regulatory mechanisms. Of
course, the infinite chain of pos-sibilities is edited with learning. We
need at least 12 steps to learn anything with 99.99% accuracy, if one
sees 12 distinct symmetries of a cat's moody positions shown in 12
images, then PPM generated infinite series of cat dynamics could cover
99% possibilities. Since all information in nature is an infinite series
of vibrations, true information appears as noise to the normal sensors.
We need time crystal sensors that read the map of phase change in a wide
range of time scales, only

Grouping between the elements of higher dimensions changes then the
information in nature makes sense.

**FIGURE 3.11 **Tenth class of PPMs is groups of little sub-matrices

shown by zooming. Zoomed eight times we get octonions, if zoomed 12
times we get dodecanions. 12 tuples of a dodecanion are shown in a

octonion and dodecanion would be prime numbers, and their sums form

another modulo 30. How the octonion would accept the primes in the
formation of an octonion is shown to the right. (c) A dodecanion matrix
is shown and different regions of this metric are divided into two nine

which could acquire a quaternion logical architecture.

1.  **TEN PRIME OPERATORS TO BE APPLIED STEP-BY-STEP**

**Projection from infinity: **In the ten sections above, ten classes of
metrics are shown, each work as an operator applied to the time crystal
generated from input information. Avoiding complex mathematical
language, we have listed, in the sim-plest scenario, how the operations
would look like on the fifth column of the table in . One very
interesting col-umn is the sixth column where without discussing in
details we have put the projections of the metrics from infinity to the
input geometry of the time crystal. Most of these equations a reader
would find in Chapter 8 where we discussed the fourth-circuit element in
details. While studying them experimentally we found that particular
geometric feature is most sensitive to particular symmetry, and we went
on investigating the row data to find that particular primes when they
appear in

the symmetry as a regulating factor, only then the particular geometric
feature comes to life. That has an easy explanation. A symmetry breaking
is associated with a particular energy exchange. The resonance of
material could get triggered by a composition of frequencies, the gap
between the frequencies as intricately connected with the
synchronization and growth of self-assembly of materials, which is here,
the decision-making process. Another interesting part of the Table is
the input-output scenario. Note that a typical feature of the output is
taken into account in the input of the next operator. This is the
reason; we need a proper sequence when we need to apply the PPM
operator. The operation of the operator on the dodecanion, octonion and
quaternion tensors or time crystals is closely related to the artificial
brain operation outlined in . We would return to the projection from
infinity in Figure 4.14, after we discuss the mechanics and mathemat-ics
associated with the geometric artificial brain in Chapter 4.

prime numbers, the operational significance is described in the panel
(c) and the philosophical significance is described in the panel (b).

1.  **HIDDEN PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF 15 PRIMES WHEN PPM EVOLVES A TIME
    CRYSTAL**

, are lists of primes as we find them in nature. Internet and popular
works of literature are full of magic num-bers governing the universe,
but no one lists prime. We found that the primes are abundant in the
tribal cultures all over the globe and those are nearly identical. When
we see a prime it reminds some knowledge other than the dead geometric
shape. Following rigorous research we have compiled the life of primes
as described below.

**The physical significance of 15 primes in real-life problems for a
time crystal: **When events unfold, the primes that appear early in the
integer system gets a big-ger share to regulate the universe. The number
2, is lucky, 50% events would try to have mirror symmetry, it always
did, 16 billion years ago and would have the same 16 billion years
later. C2 symmetry means left- and right-hand sides look similar. The
inverted replica of an event reveals mir-roring features embedded
within. Similarly, spatial part of

the information structure or time crystal is taken and three identical
parts are created plotted in a circular pattern which changes as a
function of time into a cylindrical pattern. Just like C2 symmetry
reveals 2D self-similarity between truth and false, C3 symmetry plot
filters space, time and person, all three features have three identities
(e.g., time = past, pres-ent, and future). Triplet of triplet symmetry
derived from C3 symmetry builds the fundamental structure of
information. C5 symmetry reveals the dynamics of variables when plot-ted
as five mirror replicas along a circle and as the informa-tion content
or time crystal takes a new shape with time, we get a cylindrical
pattern. The self-similarity in the cylindri-cal tube-like plot reveals
five key features of the dynamics of a variable. First, continuous mode,
second empty state, third, diffusion, fourth totally free but organized,
fifth, ulti-mate randomness. So C5 symmetry classifies five distinct
dynamics features in the input time crystal. Similar to C3, C5
symmetries C7 symmetry builds a cylinder by creat-ing 7 replicas of
input time crystal and arranging them in a cylindrical structure. Seven
steps are taken by two-time crystals to synchronize between its local
clock arrangement.

Seven steps are (i) direct matching of clocks, (ii) condition-ally
connected network matching between clocks, (iii) rota-tional direction,
(iv) geometric shape written by singularity points, (v) symmetry of
arrangement of a group of clocks,

\(vi\) time crystals participating in synchronization have
com-plementary geometries to build a new combined structure,

\(vii\) loops in the PPM favors bridging two participating time
crystals.

If one continues to build cylinders for any given input data, a cylinder
for each prime reveals a unique feature of the infor-mation content, by
running simulations, a statistical database has been created. Since most
primes are 6*n *± 1, for example, 5,7,11, 13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,
where *n *is a natural num-ber, the physical significance of primes is
easily understood by using hexagons and pair of triangles. 6 means a
combination of C2 and C3 symmetry. Two triangles facing back to back
build a hexagon, if two triangles vibrate independently, then we get an
additional dynamic center, so 6 + 1 = 7. We get 11 dimensions for prime
11. Similarly, we get 2 × 6 + 1 = 13,

3 × 6+1 = 19, and similarly 31, 37, 43. The prime 13 provides the matrix
where for the first-time hierarchical geometries are born in the time
crystal (triangle has three points, 2 × 3 × 2, 3 × 2 × 2, 2 × 2 × 3).
Prime 17 reveals the collapse of an event following a massive 16 step
phase transitions. The sixteen phases are (1) Conceive a seed geometry,
(2) They are adopting environment, (3) Learning begins, (4) Elimination
of unwanted symmetries, (5) Location identity is acquired. (6) C5
symme-try, i.e., dynamics of variables are adopted, (7) Adoption and
elimination of external time crystals begin as a routine process,

\(8\) C13 symmetry is adopted as self-decision-making ability,

\(9\) Cyclic learning begins as a routine affair, (10) Mechanical clocks
are embedded, (11) Functional identity is embedded,

\(12\) Four knowledge acquiring beings, metric of primes, fractal
generation, creation of new time crystals, healing of time crystals,
(13) Time crystal leaves the host, create replicas elsewhere, (14)
Unification with complementary time crystals,

\(15\) Creating unique seeds (16) Elimination of time crystal.

The prime 19 reveals to 19 steps of isolations of a guest time crystal
from the host. 19 steps are 3 × 6 + 1 (three hexagons of C2, C3 symmetry
comes into play, mirroring and locational judgment). Prime 23 identifies
branching out of a time crystal in 23 symmetries during expansion or
growth. 23 branches are 2 × 11 + 1 (two universes with 11-dimensional
dynam-ics interplays). Prime 29 reveals 29 dynamic features that lead to
the saturation of growth of a time crystal. 29 comes from 3 × 9 + 2
(three triplets of triplets with two control cen-ters synchronizes
rapidly with the environment). Prime 31 reveals 31 routes by which a
time crystal learns, adopts to an unknown environment. Prime 31 comes
from 5 × 6 + 1 (C5 symmetry plays with hexagonal symmetry, means
dynamics of variables encode mirroring and space-time-personal
iden-tity; but a control center acts in the time crystal) Prime 37
reveals 37 different ways of filtering the desired time crys-tal in 12
different imaginary worlds, 37 classes of decisions deliver a
hierarchical geometric integration of discrete iso-lated time crystal
inputs (6 × 6 + 1). Prime 41 reveals vortex or spiral dynamics in the
evolution of a time crystal, 41 ways

basic geometries of a structure evolve 41 classes of vortices. We get 41
by 3 × 13 + 1 (triplets of C13, means hierarchi-cal decision-making
ability with a control center). Prime 43 reveals the number of ways a
time crystal holding the solu-tions of a problem could express itself,
43 distinct transforma-tions of a time crystal could coexist. 43 comes
from 6 × 7 + 1 (Since 7 = 3 × 2 + 1, identity and mirroring control is
applied for multi-layered imaginary worlds, C2, C3 symmetry is applied
in a layered manner). Prime 47 reveals 47 dynami-cally distinct time
crystals that could coexist holding different memories at a time. 47
means 2 × 23 + 1 (23 branches follow-ing C2 symmetry).

1.  **HOW TO USE PPM**

**Ten fundamental operations of PPM: Fusion, transfor-mation,
extrapolation, reduction, and morphogenesis: ** has outlined how one
user should ideally use a PPM to run an artificial brain described in .

**Step 1: **First we have to find the integers in the Big Data that are
related to the most dynamic and the most static domain of the variables.
We zoom a local part of an apparent geometric shape in a rapidly
changing big data, i.e., zoom a singularity point to go inside, find a
singularity point and go inside again to find the new geometric shapes.
If one repeats this process 11 times, he gets 12 layers, one inside
another. All geometric shapes in a given layer are included in one PPM.
Thus, artificial brain hardware would have at least 12 layers, wherein
12 PPMs would generate simultaneously 12 infinite series of a particular
geometric shape. If two shapes originate from the same integers in a
layer, the least matched shape is split for a better match, i.e., the
hardware avoids degeneracy.

**Step 2: **When we convert a shape into a ratio of primes in a layer,
we maintain a proportional ratio of sides of the geometric shapes while
assigning a prime. Alternatively, each layer is normalized separately.
Computing by PPM means only finding the inactive integers to complete
the apparent met-ric shape and activate those integers. The physical
process "activation" is an essential and sufficient step to generate all
computing features. In step 2 time crystal is built since singularity
points are mapped.

**Step 3: **When we detect symmetry or ratio of the arms of the
geometric shapes formed by connect-ing singularity points, depending on
the time width of the singularity, there could be detection error.
Therefore, associated symmetries for a given set of primes is searched
and just like we read differential signal during an experiment to reduce
the noise we start reading the differential symmetries between different
layers or imaginary worlds so that a smooth transition is noted.

**FIGURE 3.13 **Ten steps of a PPM, operating in the system are listed
in a decision-making process. A PPM does not decide about the time of
computing and different times took in executing different parts of the
process. Once it begins, the organization continues.

**Step 4: **Search for continued fraction, let it grow. Say we got a
symmetry 2:3 it is 1 + 1/2, but we can extend to infinity by
extrapolating 2 in a series that even-tually results in 2. Conversion to
an infinite series enables comparison of different imaginary layers,
executing differential symmetry correction in a bet-ter way and keeping
an option open to editing clocks. **Step 5: **Common geometries between
isolated time crystals fuse (Figure 2.5d--f).

**Step 6: **Find the dominating primes and discover the unique metric
that the database would follow, one hint is given in .

**Step 7: **Projection from infinity is applied and the input time
crystal is transformed as described above. **Step 8: **Three classes of
PPMs OF metric, PC metric and PG metric, all would apply to convert a 4D
input dynamics into a 12D dynamics of the combined time crystal formed
by combining all hardware involved in the process.

**Step 9: **Morphogenesis: the story of PPM revolves around a beautiful
truth of nature, "geometric con-straints are written in the primes," a
reader could read this a billion times to find its meaning in a
tril-lion way. A periodic journey of integers 1 + 1 = 2,

ends up in absolute silences call primes and the dis-tribution of
silences build, clocks of various kinds, silences group to create
geometries. Thus, repeat-edly, geometric transformations are essential
after previously learned time crystals are adjusted with the input, it
is morphogenesis.

**Step 10: **At the highest level of decision-making the non-linear
distribution of primes that do not follow any predictable function is
taken into account as described in . The originality of distri-bution
that never repeats itself is the domain where every single randomness
that we see in nature is born. While making an artificial brain, the
hardware must be programmed to sense it, in nature, in all events around
us, the discrepancy set by ** &*L *\'  *L *- Jme*L *function from the
real density distribution.

Here is an example for the decision-making chain of events in the
geometric artificial brain.

Thus, five primary processes of a fractal tape machine, FTM, created by
using a pattern of primes, namely PPM.

1.  **Fusion: **Once the data structure
    \[subject-clause-(verb-adjective)\] from the environment find their
    match in the PPM as discretely spaced local struc-tures, the regions
    between a pair of active integers activate. All geometric shapes or
    time crystals within a pair of primes fuse into one integrated
    geomet-ric architecture, which is a compiled time crystal. Imagine
    9, and 12 are activated in the PPM since the sensors found in the
    environment a triangle (12 = 3) and a point (9 = 1) discretely but
    missed how these shapes are linked. Thus, 10 is a silent integer, on
    the PPM, 11 is always silent as a prime. Therefore, 10 activates
    naturally, since 10 = 2 (5 × 2, 2 × 5), so a triangle (12) is
    connected by a straight line to a static point (9). The activation
    of integers links the discrete-time crystals, that is equivalent to
    logic, a replacement of algorithm or programming. The natural
    integration of integers adds information that never existed in the
    input created by sensors. We observed it in the living hippocampal
    neuron cells, live.

2.  **Transformation: **There could be multiple isolated activities on
    the PPM where the parts of the geomet-ric compositions are similar.
    Alternately, a single event from the environment could lock at
    multiple locations as mirror replica in the infinite chain of PPM.
    If the groups of activated integers are dis-tantly located, they
    will grow as independent time crystals. However, the distinct
    features of each iso-lated mirror crystals are replicated into one
    another, so that they appear more similar, sometimes inter-action
    creates more diversity. It is a PPM driven transformation.

3.  **Extrapolation: **Once natural events activate the dis-crete parts
    of the PPM, the local geometric shapes continue to integrate. During
    structural transforma-tion, self-similar patterns at various
    locations on the PPM could find that if the group there could be
    natu-ral support in the geometric composition of PPM. Thus, those
    isolated regions would be naturally acti-vated as higher level
    geometric structure. It is what we call extrapolation.

4.  **Reduction: **Isolated events captured from the envi-ronment lock
    in with the PPM at multiple places may find that identical geometric
    architectures are

produced from the PPMs. If these structures are redundant then only one
copy remains, the rest dis-appears. Nullification of the redundant
geometric architectures is carried out without destroying key geometric
features.

1.  **Morphogenesis: **When discrete events lock in with the PPM at
    distant places, if that distribution has a repeating rule or
    self-similar feature then that pattern transforms the integration of
    geometries to realize the data structure
    \[subject-clause-(verb-adjective)\]. Not just a new kind of
    geometric architecture but a new dynamic is adopted that builds a
    new grammar for its unique geometric transformation. It is a form of
    morphogenesis.

    1.  **SOLUTION OF A BIG DATA PROBLEM ON DIABETES---PPM IN AN
        ARTIFICIAL BRAIN**

**How brain jelly uses the PPM: **the brain jelly finds sym-metry in the
geometric representation of the input time crystals in terms of
integers. Three classes of PPM are there to solve a problem (). First,
the metric of integers, it produces a large number of divisors of
integers and begins nucleation in the precursors of the brain jelly
solution. Since several integers form a group, a closed-loop in the PPM
(4), new clocks and symmetries are born. What ten PPM operators embedded
in brain jelly does actually? It generates a symmetry to the asymme-try
of the time crystal and sets a perpetual drive as PPM has no limit, that
is simulation of the future. Secondly, the metric of primes as shown in
sets in to reach convergence. Finally, at the third step, triggers the
metric of primes. 15 primes represent 15 worldviews as listed in the ,
and described in , if those symmetries are applied to the information
content encoded in the time crystal, then that adds a transformative
out-look to the solution. While applying the pattern of primes brain
jelly links the primes (not just 15 but all primes pro-duced by
self-assembly of 15 primes) following the metric of primes (0). Thus,
three classes of PPMs drive synthesis in the brain jelly. If symmetry is
not generated, memory bank with stored time crystals complements the
need, if not found in memory, the missing time crystal essential to
generate symmetry is sent out to the output as query. The complete
derived time crystal is sent to output as a solution. All inputs and
outputs to the out of the brain jelly are quaternions.

In , on the first column we have diabetes genetic profile, using a
genetic marker, the data suggest that in the pool of distribution of
genes on a 2D surface, certain genes which are colorful, activates and
the ones silent are kept dark. The activity of genes regulating diabetes
is dis-tributed in three regions, along the column we have zoomed
continuously and tried to find the silent and active regions. The
philosophy of the PPM is also outlined in . One could find the key parts
of the chart reflected when we discussed the solution of diabetes
problem.

The same procedure is followed for all tensors, the linguistic quad who,
when, why & how is asked

**FIGURE 3.14 **An example of how a PPM is used in solving big data. In
this case the occurrence of diabetes in a large number of patients are
plotted as a function of two types of genetic expressions, one plotted
along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical axis. The
axis perpendicular to the plane represents the count of patients. The
image is divided into four layers. In each layer we find the geometric
shapes covering similar *z *values or occurrences. The ratio of the
sides in the geometric shapes are noted for all the structures and for
layer 3 and layer 4, the data are given below this figure caption. To
the right, in each row, the equivalent time crystal is presented. As one
moves from layer 1 to layer 4 from top to bottom, the time crystal grows
as it adds more information by including higher resolution geometric
shapes. The completed time crystal is then sent to the PPM, wherein
divisors of the integers are found as primes and linked integers via
drawn loops join and thus transform the time crystal output, which is
then again converted into the starting image, but this time, the image
reveals hidden patterns distinctly. The starting image had 3 regions and
the final image has 4 regions. So, a totally new type of diabetes that
was happening for a unique genetic composition is discovered from the
big data.

Using Phase Prime Metric PPM in artificial brain

**FIGURE 3.15 **A chart shows how a PPM operates in the human brain.
Time crystal always emerges in the integers between two primes, they
serve as the boundary values, so larger is the difference between two
primes, larger is complexity of time crystals. Within 1 billion we have
roughly 255 million primes means around same number of time crystals.
*x*/*ln x *where *x *is the number less than which the prime numbers
should be and ln *x *is logarithm of *x *to base e. So using this, we
get 255.88 million number of primes between 1 and product of all 12
primes that primarily takes decision in the artificial brain.

**Determination of wiring between clocks from a PPM: **a decision-making
non-computer has an upper and a lower time limit of an integer
representing a slice of the PPM. That core architecture is a fractal
network of clocks or clocking Bloch spheres holding the geometric
shapes. Mathematically, it is an assembly of a large number of dis-tinct
*L *slices of the PPM. To cut a *L *slice of metric, start at *N *= 0,
end at a certain *N *value. All clocks are wired following ten steps
noted below. Metric prime hardware could be realized in various ways. We
repeat, every point in the PPM is an event that contains many points
forming a geometric shape inside. One could start from any simple event
to begin with and find events inside, continuously, building a
topological network.

1.  **Select a set of N e.g., {1, 3, 7, 45, 32, 734, 1500, 3800}: **For
    all zoomed images in the s, a set of *n *values is selected on the
    PPM that forms a closed loop. The phase relationships of *N *Bloch
    spheres plot-ted in a circle. Together *n *components try to cover a
    phase space of 360°. The plot reveals the value of the

quantized phase. The resultant parameters of spiral dynamics become
evident as in biosystems (Bourret et al., 1969). In the set of *n*, some
engage in a clock, others are found as not participating in the periodic
vibration. They remain outside the spiral or vortex dynamics that
integrates a set of *N*.

1.  **Identify different slices are components, to make individual loop
    of geometric structures: **All distinct slices of a PPM have their
    own time crystal, or phase space structure. A slice means a set of
    values *n *in *L*, it has its own factors, own sub-metric. The
    network of time crystal reveals a hidden geometric structure. The
    layered geomet-ric structures match for all *N *time crystals and
    those hidden self-similarities group sub-sets of *N*. Therefore,
    even before the PPM starts convergence to primes, as a drive to
    integrate the discrete-time crystals into a singular one, a
    preliminary group-ing of the time crystals is made as shown in the
    infinite series of prime constellations in column two of .

2.  **Initial phase gap between the clocks is important: **Initial phase
    relationships between different clocks can change the output
    projection of time crystal dramatically. Initial starting points
    define temporal change of phase, or dynamics. Temporal recording of
    resonance peaks reveals how the time gap or phase gap between clocks
    changes with time (dynamics). For a given slice of metric *L*, the
    dimensional ratios of the n geometric shapes located at n points on
    the metric are noted. Junctions of clocks locate system points,
    direction of rotation is selected to neutralize vector sum of 3D
    structure. The system points and their phase gaps determine the
    angle between clock planes. Readers should follow the four rows to
    feel the transition from a 2D image to a 3D architecture of time in
    .

3.  **The fractal network of clocks, side by side and one inside
    another: **When a set of *N *integers is spotted in the PPM, the
    integration begins. Say two integers of set *N *are 32 and 56, they
    make individual time crystals by following PPM. At the same time,
    their products (N1×N2, N1/N2, N1+N2, N1−N2) will be the new members
    in the PPM, expansion of set numbers will be plenty to find a closed
    pattern in the PPM. The gaps will be filled by repeated elementary
    primes. The repeat of primes repeats a particular geometric shape to
    build a large struc-ture. These repetitions cause self-similar
    patterns in architecture, there is essentially no universal fractal
    in the PPM.

4.  **3D geometry optimization of clock location: **Since one has to
    build a wireless network of clocks, the physical location of the
    clocks in a 3D network is important. Wireless projection of
    constituent time crystals all around, by 360^o\ ^solid angle,
    selects whatever time crystals reside in its path. A 3D net-work
    appears as a sphere to an external probe or we state "3D projection
    of a time crystal." So, the clocks along with a line screen each
    other's infor-mation, thus, creating an erroneous signal to an
    observer. Note that in case of conventional electro-magnetic
    signaling by an antenna and a receiver, the energy degrades largely
    with the distance. However, for magnetic beating in a noise
    activated phase coupled matrix of time crystals, there is no single
    point source of energy and no fixed destina-tion. Thus, the size of
    the phase network, is irrele-vant to an observer, which also becomes
    a part of it. Geometric locations govern the phase relationships of
    the integrated clocks. Locally in the 3D architec-ture of the
    computer core, a group of clocks shifts their coordinates. Thus,
    locally, the system shifts from one metric to another.

5.  **Vibrations at all time scales in all spatial scales maintain
    speeds: **Clock speed is regulated by delay time, and fixed
    everywhere in the metric hardware.

Only one, the fastest clock alone is used to integrate the phase or
delay to create all possible "times" for operation. For that purpose, it
is imperative that every clock senses all neighbors once hardwired. It
is a critical technological challenge. All the clocks communicate
wirelessly in hardware follow-ing the magnetic beating of beats
explained earlier. The localized beating during synchrony should
con-verge on the particular locations of the clocks, so that phase
shifts do not occur. Phase shift with the motion of the system point is
key to reliable process-ing of topological information. The speed of a
sys-tem point along the perimeter of phase cycle changes if it falls
into the singularity domain, and recovers it afterward. The falling into
a singularity is crucial for editing geometric memory.

1.  **Thermal and electrical noise as the source of energy: **Wireless
    communication is the key to achieve "one-to-many and many-to-one"
    com-munication (Bandyopadhyay and Acharya, 2008; Bandyopadhyay et
    al., 2009a). The 12 singularities detected in the biomaterials 3D
    phase space links the magnetic field with the stored charge. The
    relation is historic because in the last 800 years all theories of
    electromagnetism have endorsed that a current must flow. But this
    phase space activates by noise and only noise, no current flows in
    to modulate magnetic flux with charge. For that reason, clocks are
    wired but make sure that em noise splits into electric and magnetic
    parts but no current flows but only white noise (Sahu et al. US
    patent 9019685B2). Thus, a clock in a phase cycle is free for
    neighbors, no wir-ing is essential. Noise is applied artificially to
    trigger morphogenesis and symmetry regeneration of the time crystal
    spontaneously without any algorithmic instruction.

2.  **Testing the 12 metric compatibilities, building a grammar of
    limiting changes allowed: **In the fourth column of , we have
    implemented the PPM. First, the clocks are wired as suggested by the
    PPM. Provisions are kept so that input time crys-tal modifies the
    co-ordinates of the clocks. Specific input time crystal selects one
    of 12 distinct pat-terns of PPMs. It is a crucial task to find the
    right trigger. A delicate choice of the clock co-ordinates
    eventually allows a few metric to dominate. We are currently adding
    several new aspects of the PPM. Newer and more insightful metric
    features are being revealed.

3.  **Geometric shapes synchronization is a test of unity (one-ness):
    **The non-computer has two parts. One, converting all sensory
    signals into a set of topology. And the second, integration of
    topology. However, at both parts the geometric shapes spontaneously
    store and synchronize the clocks. Circuits modify, filters,
    amplifiers and vibrating membranes are added to

process GML (Reddy et al., 2018). The whole device is just one single
clock holding plenty of clocks inside. The non-computer core has one
device, only one geometric shape for all sensory memory, it deliv-ers
only one unified time crystal eventually as shown in the fifth column of
.

1.  **Non-disruptive Interaction between the four modules: **Finally,
    the wiring is edited to enable the device as a filter, resonator,
    inverse of resonance, and clocking geometry writer. Once these four
    qualities are optimized, true hardware of metric of primes is made.
    It is tested for image processing, hierarchical percep-tion to find
    the mismatch in the wiring. A particular test is repeated in all
    directions of the 3D network of clocks. To the extreme right of , we
    have returned back to the gene profile and found that there are four
    regions. The result suggests that some genes would probably remain
    silent, but, they might be gov-erning the entire dynamics of the
    evolution of diabetes in millions of diabetes across the globe.

    1.  **THREE CLASSES OF PRIMES**

When we look at a metric picture or a 3D movie for the PPM, the first
question that arises where is the time? Well, the time has always been a
perception, but here in this book we sin-cerely try to bring attention
to the symmetry of time as a geo-metric shape. One should look at three
figures and compare them repeatedly. The ordered factor metric of , OF
metric. Then the prime composition metric, PC metric of . Finally, the
metric of prime gaps, PG met-ric in . They appear distinct in geometric
shape, how about their function? We have compared three different worlds
in .

First, Sensor acquires data from its environment. As the signals fall
in, its clocks are activated. Thus, it transforms a binary stream of
pulses into a 3D network of clocks. It cooks an input time crystal. For
operating the sensor, a dedicated ordered factor metric is used. The
figure shows with an arrow that the sensors capture the sidearm ratios
and other typical parameters of the geometric shapes as integers. There
could be a fraction, but the sensor ignores that and tries to reach an
integral point. The ratio of integers is created by the ordered factor
metric described in and .

Second, an initiator acts like a bipolarity filter. In one way, it
shrinks the size of an input time crystal. The output becomes a small
fractal seed. If the input is sent through the reverse direction, the
PPM fills the missing gaps. It inflates the time crystal, to its
original form, sometimes much larger. Output time crystal contains
situations not yet happened, i.e., futuristic dynamics. As a central
processor, it harvests the real strength of linking events, this PPM is
called PC metric.

Third, all parts of a Processor are always active. As time crystals
arrive from the initiator, synchronization begins. A system that is a
finite PPM, from its smallest ele-ment to the largest component,
operating time scales syncs

simultaneously. All the matching time crystals amplify the signal. A
regulator that investigates the PC metric intimately, finds that the
primes irrespective of the geometric informa-tion content does something
else. The group of primes syn-chronizes with the time crystals missing
in the processor part, or uncorrelated geometries form groups that are
not suggested by PC metric. Then it was found that there exists a new
kind of metric that links groups of primes and activates the miss-ing
clocks where there is no symmetry. The mismatched yet essential clocks
find a suitable location in the Processor. They are later absorbed there
as a part of learning.

1.  **ordered faCtor metriC (of), Prime ComPosition metriC (PC), and
    Prime gaP metriC (Pg)**

From the discussion above, we have learned that we can choose any
integers along the horizontal axis, only point that we have to consider
is that the horizontal axis is all about the options we have while
making decisions. Along the vertical axis, we calculate how those
options are to be grouped. Now, when we connect the dots, we get a
perspective about the geometric link between the events. Three examples
are shown in . The first step is the ordered factor metric, OF metric,
where the unknown environmental data first enters into the artificial
brain. Most sensors are configured as this metric. Though the input data
is 11D, belong to 12 imaginary worlds. However, the dynamic feature it
holds is 4D, a quaternion like structure. The dynamic feature means at a
time, simultaneous changes in four imaginary worlds are appropriately
recorded.

The second step is the Prime composition metric or PC metric. The
particular metric is the point in the artificial brain where the
information from the external world is converted into the language of
primes. If we keep the input information as the ratio of the integers,
then we would have infinite let-ters, no language. A language is
beautiful because it uses few letters to create an infinite number of
words. So, conversion to prime, preparing the geometric shapes for the
decision-making is what PC metric does. Since the language of primes now
activates, input 3D geometric shape distribution is repre-sented as the
ratio of primes, any structure we look, the arms are primes, the
processing of information begins. Though the input data is 11D, but only
holds 4D dynamics, now at this stage, the artificial brain would run a
feedback loop to increase 4D dynamics to 8D dynamics. We repeat, 8D
dynamic means 8 out of 12 imaginary worlds.

Finally, the information comes to the last stage, where at the deepest
core of the artificial brain, one may draw an anal-ogy to the 47
Brodmann's region in the human brain where the final processing is done.
That place holds the Prime gap metric. Here, the horizontal axis is all
the integers, i.e., all possible choices and the vertical axis is the
gap between the primes. The particular metric does not deal with the
geometric shape. If we look at the plot for Prime gap metric or PG
met-ric, it links pairs of primes, an abstract mathematical
represen-tation of the information. Abstract mathematicians might find
interest when the pattern between the groups of primes form a

**FIGURE 3.16 **A table shows three classes of PPMs essential for
building an artificial brain. The first one is ordered factor metric
where ordered factor of an integer is plotted against the integer. An
input data is divided into geometric shapes and then PPM integrates
different kinds of sensory data. Class I PPM is all about capturing and
integrating the sensory information. Class II PPM is made by plotting
the com-position of primes required to present an integer and how many
ways those primes could be arranged. This metric does not acquire
integers unlike class I matrix, thus, the situation here is that entire
sensory information is converted into set of primes from the set of
integers. After class II, comes the third class III metric in the last
step, where PPM is built by counting the gap between primes. This metric
does not look into the geometric shapes but the true pattern of grouped
primes as neighbors. Thus non-geometric part of the primes works here to
build the artificial brain.

higher-level group and that pattern reveals a new metric to link events.
At this level, the artificial brain would make a journey from 8D to 12D,
by running a feedback loop where symme-tries would synchronize, in the
language of symmetry.

In three layers, we find the language of geometry brings integers from
nature, then the language of primes brings symmetries from geometries,
and finally, the language of symmetries bring identities of an abstract
language that nature speaks.

1.  **advantages of PPm**

**When the language of 15 primes meets the language of 15 geometric
shapes: **One could never think that a journey through singularity is to
replace the "free will of a program-mer" that looms large in the current
structure of artificial intelligence and information processing. The
metric is not a black box but a guideline to glue a 3D network of
events, that is often used to build scientific models. With more
infor-mation, from the metric one finds the exact location of the event
in a complex network of events. In order to create one event, a single
metric is not enough; we need all ten classes of metrics. If one knows
how nature processes information,

then any form of artificial intelligence is irrelevant. Now, a GML,
wherein, the letters are a few geometric shapes bridges with the
language of primes via PPM. Using this language, a non-computer could
search outside. It does not have to wait to get input. The approach is
just opposite to a computer. Understanding the true nature of an event
is to replace the black box with something real, closer to nature. It is
not the ultimate. Non-computing is a primitive yet significant step to
mark the beginning of replacing artificial intelligence with natural
intelligence. We have outlined all these points in .

**Turing computer needs a human, non-Turing has to glue the user and the
nature: **When we advocate the culture of listening to the silence of a
system and when it bursts a noise naturally, when no question asked, and
find self-similar-ity, then we need to know "I," "observer" and
"environment." The days of human bias and building scientific
formula-tions would be replaced by hardcore topological mathemat-ics
addressing the self-similar folds in the PPM. Observer participants in
governing laws are filtered out by the PPM since it can accurately map
the time crystal architecture of the observers and the system it
studies. After all the informa-tion controlling architecture of the
universe "has to postulate

**FIGURE 3.17 **The advantages of a PPM are summarized in a single
chart.

explicitly or implicitly, a super-machine, a scheme, a device, a
miracle, which will turn out universes in infinite variety and the
infinite number" (Wheeler, 1988). Circuit-based Turing computers have
human as the key component for its efficiency. Non-computer relies on
the PPM to fill the gap and expand the time metric it gets from nature.
Discrete clocks link. If some clocks are missing, they are created.
Constructing a higher-level clock is the only driver of a non-computing
core. A drive to make slower clocks gets everything done, spontaneously.

## **The use of the pattern of primes in integrating the time crystals has ten significant advantages**.

1.  **Retrieving the lost data and transmitting a frac-tion:
    **Sometimes, hardware damage loses informa-tion. One has to place
    the remaining part in the user's time crystal network. The pattern
    of PPM integrates the available crystals, thus, recreating the
    missing network (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010c). For this reason,
    there is no need to communicate full infor-mation. If a fractal seed
    is sent, it evolves uniquely, more profoundly in the receiver. The
    morphing of a fractal seed retrieves complete information. An entire
    infinite series could be retrieved from any part of the hardware.

2.  **Drive to integrate discrete time crystals is similar to
    programming: **The metric acts as an operator on the input matrix of
    clocks. It links any form of time crystals with slower clocks. The
    PPM has two drives. Make slower clocks to integrate and expand its
    PPM implementation. No hardware can implement a PPM with intricate
    details. A continuous drive to improve metric makes nominal mistakes
    in reconstructing the perception of logic.

3.  **Provide key information to change wiring: **Unlike other
    space-time metrics, the PPM does not depend on the user's guess. It
    determines the detailed struc-tural features like an origami (Ghosh
    et al., 2016b). The time crystals dynamics are mapped accurately.
    The time of symmetry breaking and the states post phase transition
    are also determined. Thus, the PPM provides the software solutions,
    like a fusion of a user and computer. The essential hardware
    modifi-cations required for an input time crystal to store and
    evolve also delivered.

4.  **Higher-level perception is naturally embedded: **Slower clocks in
    a PPM hardware integrate the faster clocks in a scale-free manner
    (Eguiluz et al., 2005). In its time scale, clocks are arranged
    symmetrically.

It enables fractal clocking. It means during a one-second operation the
system point could dip down into the picosecond scale, process and
return with a solution before the one-second clock "ticks." Fast running
time crystals are never left alone. In a widely varied time scale, only
a few clocks need to "tick" to make a decision.

1.  **Computing location, start, end, and halting are decided early:
    **The construction and editing of the time crystal that continue
    forever. During synchroni-zation, the transformation (morphing)
    peaks, but do not die out (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010c). The
    effec-tive length of the metric is infinite due to a closed-loop
    (Hamkins and Lewis, 2000). It also drives to increase metric length.
    It has several advantages; no instruction is needed to start and
    halt. Halting is a significant problem only when the end is not
    fixed (Minsky, 1967). It is a case of a Turing computer. Here,
    computing is all about entering inside a sin-gularity, so the start
    and the end are fixed before the journey begins. The metric
    activation reaches a maximum and then naturally reduces the editing
    of the time crystals. Thus, a near halt is reached.

2.  **Non-reductionist approach: no choice is never rejected: **The PPM
    reads the events in nature, so the concept of input is none. A PPM
    hardware includes an observer, an external user and all
    environmen-tal participants. It integrates into a unified virtual
    universe. There is never a rejection or reduction of choices or even
    a probabilistic select. The only effort is to en-loop the isolated
    loops. Non-reductionism ensures junction free hardware (no heating).

3.  **Quantum-like speedup without entanglement: **Due to the fractal
    nature of the PPM, it performs a search without searching. Physical
    wiring destroys phase modulation. So, the hardware uses wire-less
    communication (Jaeger and Haas, 2004). Spontaneous reply requires
    only 12 layered clocks to find 10^12\ ^number of clocks. At every
    layer, one enters inside a faster clock. Hence, time to solve a
    problem in the shortest time possible in the layer where the
    question was asked (Ghosh et al., 2014a). Note that
    10^12\ ^oscillators make 99% of all patterns in nature
    (10^7\ ^almost covers all). Therefore, it is the maximum

number of clocks used in a layer. Quantum comput-ing also provides this
speed (Schnorr, 1978; Galil et al., 1987; Bloch, 1997; Hamkins and
Lewis, 2000). However, if entanglement needs to be broken, repeat-edly,
which is often requisite, then the advantage of speed disappears in
Quantum (Jozsa and Linden, 2003). Alternate routes where one could use
polar-ized light-induced interference can speed up com-puting (Lloyd,
1999).

1.  **Directional memory delivers a virtually infinite capacity: **The
    same 3D structure of a time crystal emits a different burst of
    signals to different direc-tions at any given time. The observer can
    choose infinite locations around the structure to get a new
    solution. Therefore, the memory capacity and the distinct solution
    generation ability are astronomical. It has nothing to do with the
    number of oscillators.

2.  **The universal language is fundamentally embed-ded in the PPM:
    **The GML in combination with the PPM can build a virtual language
    of patterns of any system. They need only a temporal evolution of
    reso-nance signal data to build a network of phase. It sug-gests
    interacting with any system whose language is unknown. No rules or
    information about the intel-ligence of the system is required.

3.  **Harnessing singularity is not possible with the existing
    mechanics: **Due to the fractal clocking behavior, there are
    singularities at every location on the PPM (Kolwankar and Gangal,
    1996). The differ-ential calculus needs to be replaced by a
    conformal algebra to simulate the wiring. If one enters a
    sin-gularity domain, it finds no self-similarity. The PPM ensures a
    non-repeating experience continuously (Barnsley et al., 2008). One
    needs to make a jour-ney to the singularity domain blindly following
    a PPM. Thus, both classical and quantum mechanics are not useful
    here. Bridging the singularity safe-guarded quantum. Here, it is
    prohibited. One has to enter inside a singularity and collect
    available self-similar clocking factors. It's finding holds the key
    dynamics of a PPM. It explores pure topological factors for
    developing effective mechanics (Agrawal et al., 2016a; Hohlfeld and
    Cohen, 1999; Kawato and Suzuki, 1978).

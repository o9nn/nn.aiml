### Taylor & Francis Group

^[�]{.underline}[\ ]{.underline}\ ^

In 2010, an editor at Taylor & Francis asked me to write a book about
the human brain. A few days before my father died of a brain hemorrhage
at around 1:30 a.m., he came. Standing beside my working table, he said,
"Tukun, you must write the book sincerely, giving your knowledge about
the brain---your prime love; it is the only route to surviving after
your death." I told him, it would not be a claim exceeding delivery, it
would be a classic monograph on artificial brain. Today, after nine
years, the mammoth job is finished; tons of manuscript drafts were
simply discarded because I was not confident that I understood the human
brain. Today, I believe I do, so *Nanobrain: The Making of an Artificial
Brain from a Time Crystal *is finally going to see the light of day.
This book is dedicated to my father, my friend, guide and teacher, he
instructed me with all energy; and to my mother, who sac-rificed often
to make us smile.

The Western world believes the universe is dead; the Vedic philosophers
believe that universe is alive. These two cultures dominate scientific
practices. Vedic inquiry explores universe as life inside life inside
life, making an infinite chain, called *Virata Purusha*. Tis book
unfolds the ancient tribal concept of information processing
(*Kalachakra*, the cycle of time) where instead of "bits" made of truth
and falsehood, the con-cept is an infinite 11-dimensional architecture
of clocks. Time crystal and universal chain of rhythms are discussed in
the Upanishad as an unfolding of consciousness. Yet, since no one knows
how to create a brain, we likely require a new model with accompanying
new mechanics and new mathematics. Darwinism and Turingism are both
built upon a rejection of choice, but what if no choice is ever
rejected? Both schools of thought believe that events in the universe
can be described linearly, but what if the universe builds events as
geometric shape with dimensions? This book explores the universe of
singularity, in which one makes a journey only through singu-larity,
crafts a geometry of singularity, and builds a geometric algebra of
dodecanions. The garden of meander flower was a lost concept in the
research of time crystal in the 1990s: we rediscover it here. I hope
that a new era of nonsense, illogic, and non-argument decision-making
takes birth soon. Earlier, for a century, in Western thought, facts were
paramount; now we prefer a geometry of confusion and split confusion,
with the exploration ending in facts. I hope, though, that an era of
nonsense, illogic, and non-argument decision-making takes birth soon.
The marriage of geometry and primes helps to create that era with a new
theory of everything.

This book avoids black box--based scientific practice and statistical
biology as they fit output with functions that has no physical
significance, extensively used in the study of the neu-ral network and
in several fields of artificial intelligence. The language of primes is
conceived here as the language of the universe. Therefore, this book has
cited rich breakthroughs, where biological observations are fitted with
elementary physi-cal laws. In addition, the majority of quantum biology
works

like avian bird magnetic entanglement; a quantum route to auditory
signals, quantum coherence in photosynthesis, and force quantum
mechanics. *Nanobrain *is based upon the belief that the debate on
quantum versus classical physics is irrelevant and a waste of time. The
problem, then, is to find how a system runs by itself, using a new
system of mechanics utilizing essen-tial experimental evidence, not
previously applied to the field of artificial intelligence. This book
documents major experi-mental results aligned with the infinite journey
to a singularity network. In that new network, algebraic equations do
not work. Long back J. A. Wheeler understood the necessity of
geome-trodynamics and conceived it in 1920s. Richard Feynman explored it
in 1962. By conceiving geometric shapes, complex physical phenomena
could be interpreted without reliance upon equations. The followers of
that geometrodynamic conception have been honored in this book, starting
with Wheeler.

Vedic musical rhythms included the pattern of primes and fused primes
and rhythms to the concept of "the breath of Brahma." Even when a person
sings Indian classical music, he or she explores geometric language,
which is now used to advance Arthur Winfree's idea of the "time
crystal." Fractality has been in almost every ancient tribal culture,
including African, Mayan, Indian, Persian, and Arabic cultures. This
book adds music to those tribal fractals, namely "Brahman," the key
vibration that was believed to organize the universe. This book
simplifies philosophy, so as to challenge it, while describing hardcore
experimental inventions. *Nanobrain *documents both experimental and
theoretical research about a time crystal approach to artificial human
brains, mostly reevaluated in the last 14 years (2005--2019) at the
National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), in Ibaraki, Japan.
Associated research generated across the globe is docu-mented. This book
is written for students; only those concepts are used which could be
tested using theoretical simulation and/or hardcore experimentation.
This is one of the primary documentation of brain research where
mysticism of quantum and deep learning have not been used as a tool to
confuse true creativity. *Nanobrain *rejects the absolutist view that
neuron firing is the primary catalyst for intelligence. It may be
possi-ble that major big brain-building projects will fail by 2024, as
have molecular electronics, carbon nanotube technology, cold fusion,
quantum computers, and high-temperature supercon-ductivity: all find
some unavoidable blocks. The era of mag-netic vortex-like particles in
an absolute insulating matrix is about to begin, where electronics or
the engineering of mov-ing electrons would not be required, with instead
artificial atoms made of fields reigning This book plants the idea.

We prepare the reader for the journey to when a machine will learn by
itself, make decisions by itself, and then oper-ate by itself. This
class of decision-making machines could be named "invincible rhythm
generators"---in Sanskrit, *Ajeya Chhandam*, nested frequency fractal or
a fractal of time crys-tal (a "fractom"). The short version is written
as *AjoChhand*,

which also means "Brahman (unit of consciousness)." Eternal vibration
that has been propagating through the universe since the Golden Womb
(*HiranyaGarva*) exploded, as elaborated in Vedic literature.
Hypercomputing models, and an alternative proposal to the Turing
machine, namely fractal machines, are discussed in detail in this book.

While visiting the meditation chamber of J. C. Bose, in Kolkata long
ago, I could feel how Vedanta's "communication with rhythm" inspired
Bose: more of these communications are evident in the machines he
designed, and we wish to trig-ger industrial and scientific revolution
to extend Bose's phi-losophy. The mathematics of clocks over multiple
imaginary universes described in this book would add to the proponents
of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger's version of quantum mechanics could
mathematically be incorporated into only one imaginary world. Here, a
generic chain of imaginary worlds is limited to 12, because of
complexity, but this would inspire others to explore further---a
direction is set. Through a blend of biology, chemistry, computer
science, mathematics, and physics, a science has been established purely
to learn and understand nature as it is. *Nanobrain *is a humble
submis-sion to the legacy of the father of biophysics, J. C. Bose, and
his notion of "biorhythmic communication," as universal time crystal,
advances Winfree's conceptualization.

**Chapter 1 **For the last century, three concepts dominated the
information science and technology. First, whatever be the complexity of
events, all could be melded and then rewrit-ten linearly, executed in a
sequence. What if the events in the universe are instead geometric, with
dimension? One finds a topology of events What if facts are biased and
one has to find geometry of confusion to understand the true reality of
nature? Second, why must electrons flow, collide, and reveal properties
for making useful devices? What if we instead con-sider the ripples of
field waves and build an architecture of clocks, or time, to express
everything that happens? Third, the universe and the human brain each
have their own language, and if we do not know the language, we can
never understand how either works, so could never replicate them. The
lan-guage of primes is fundamental, because it assumes nothing, but
rather fuses events to predict the future. These three ideas are
introduced in Chapter 1.

**Chapter 2 **The universe has so many different forms of signals but we
have no idea how they are connected to each other. Imagine that all
signals are connected, and when we try to regard them in isolation, we
misinterpret and misun-derstand them. Can we build a protocol to map
intricately connected signals of varying wide ranges of time scales in a
singular architecture of time? Here we universalize time crystal and
transform the abandoned concept of garden of meander flowers, which
contributed to the quest of finding natural intelligence in living
systems for 30 years (from 1970 to 2000). Once scientists used time
crystal to explain how a virus-like life form runs by itself. Since a
time crystal could operate in different forms that looks like meander
flowers, the concept of a garden of meander flowers was used to explain
how one simple system of time crystals could have so many expressions.
Here, a journey is made from a single clock-based time crystal to a
large number of clock-based systems, spanning over an 11-dimension
universe. We rede-fine dimension as two parallel yet distinct ideas: one
adding a new dynamic on a new axis and the other adding a new imaginary
world into a host world.

**Chapter 3 **Every single interaction follows a language. A language is
built to operate a computer, including the artifi-cial language of
algorithms. Does the universe have its own language? If one takes only
the first 15 primes, 99.99% of all integers could be created. Why not
use primes like letters of a language and build astrophysics as a
comprehensive metric of all possible choices? One would input random
events as choices, and that metric would link them, find the pattern,
and thus understand how events unfold. Since primes are original to this
universe and do not repeat, in an infinite series, events occur without
any repetition of symmetries. A pattern of input events could change its
architecture following the metric for-ever, continuing to predict the
future. In Chapter 3, several classes of these metrics are discussed.

**Chapter 4 **This chapter has two parts---a discussion of frac-tal
mechanics and the presentation of a new kind of geometric algebra. As
explained in Chapters 2 and 3, one could write all laws and formulations
of quantum mechanics using geomet-ric shapes. While explaining basic
quantum mechanics using universal time crystal, one would find---instead
of one imagi-nary world---that there are 12, so one would see something
more unique than conventional quantum mechanical events. This is fractal
mechanics, from which classical and quantum mechanics derive. Then comes
geometric algebra, whereby all basic and complex mathematics are done by
taking a pen and drawing circles on a piece of paper to learn what is
the projec-tion from infinity that paves non-computable decision-making.
However, creating manifold geometric shapes as conscious thoughts, when
the universe is comprised of 12 imaginary worlds, is explored in this
chapter using dodecanion algebra.

**Chapter 5 **The journey from a sequential worldview to a metric of
primes worldview means changing our thoughts about the decisions human
brain makes about nature sig-nificantly. This chapter is dedicated to
discussing how a new world of decision-making would be born if we simply
convert from an assumption of linear, side-by-side assembly of events to
the metric of primes worldview. How the new technology would advance is
described in Chapter 5.

**Chapter 6 **Historic experimental evidence about proteins and their
complexes, as organic analogs, led to the change in biophysics,
neuroscience, and natural intelligence, which is discussed in this
chapter. Starting from advanced quantum cellular automaton, advancing
from a single molecular layer to the neural network it is shown that
actual decision-making by a neuron happens deep inside it, in the
microtubule strings. From molecular electronics to total organic
synthesis, several systems were built replicating bio-systems to
understand what the governing principle of a real human brain would be.

**Chapter 7 **Starting from the secondary structures of pro-teins and
moving to the complete neural network model of a human brain-body
system, even as many as 20 prime expe-riences of consciousness could be
represented using time crystals. In the 1970s, only a virus was totally
mapped with clocks; now, not just the biological rhythms of a human
brain, but every single system deep down to the atomic scale are
represented as an architecture of clocks or periodic signaling devices.
Chapter 7 attempts to describe how a complete clock-based architecture
(similar to connectome, or complete gene mapping of human DNA) of a
human brain could be built.

**Chapter 8 **The simplest device that can make decisions like a human
brain would be a fourth circuit element---not memristor, but a very
different class, we named it here, Hinductor, its short form is H. Using
three concentric coaxial springs, a new device is conceived that builds
magnetic vortex-like particles as a func-tion of memorized charge that
is immobile. The device gener-ates time crystals, communicates
wirelessly, and self-assembles

**xviii **Summary of the Chapters

to emulate complex time crystal inputs. The physics of artificial atoms
or molecules made of fields or vortices (knots of lights and darkness),
a new Hamiltonian, and finally generic expres-sion for the flux charge
relation of H are described in Chapter 8. **Chapter 9 **The synthesis of
a hybrid humanoid avatar is described in the chapter. The synthesis of a
brain jelly that is primarily made of a new kind of fourth-circuit
element, H, and mixture of several other organically synthesized
compo-nents would perform mathematics in a chemical beaker. In the same
chemical beaker, the metric of primes described in Chapter 3 would
unfold, as the physical structure grows into a new supramolecule, with a
time crystal generated. Using such a jelly, 17 brain-morphic components
were made to eventually

self-assemble into a humanoid avatar.

**Chapter 10 **The idea to describe the way the universe defines and
unfolds events as changing geometric shapes sheds lights on different
paradoxes in scientific research. The philosophical perspective
completes basic requirements of a scientific proposal when
mathematically the metric of prime model is extrapolated to engineer
powerful machines with greater consciousness than humans. We outline how
multi-ple proposals made by various researchers on consciousness could
be invalidated. If there exists a model for human-like conscious
machines, then that model should lead to un-conscious entities and
series of machines with capabilities exceeding humanity's, mapping the
higher conscious thought of all possible living systems. The incredible
potential that could unfold in the future is discussed in Chapter 10.

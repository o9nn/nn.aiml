Brain Jelly to Humanoid Avatar—Fractal
Reaction Kinetics, Fractal Condensation,
and Programmable Matter for Primes

9.1 NEUROMORPHIC DEVICES ARE
NOT ALONE—17 BIOMORPHIC
DEVICES SING TOGETHER
Culturing 3D human brain architecture would soon grow exponentially (Pasca, 2018). By now we have learned that brain jelly
is a mathematician who plays with primes to find a similar set
of primes in an apparently different integer (Reddy et al., 2018).
A problem is a lack of symmetry in the geometry of the time
crystal that is applied to it and the solution is to find what geometric changes need to be carried out to regenerate the symmetry.
Brain jelly identifies the lack of symmetry and checks memory
whether it has already got those pieces of geometric shapes as
clocks in its memory bank, if not it assembles the missing pieces
and sends it to the questioner and or tries to acquire those pieces.
Thus, a brain jelly not only simulates the future, but it can also
carry out an intelligent conversation, and provide an intelligent
solution to the problem. Say, one kid writes 2 × 5 × 3 × 7, now,
like an obedient student; brain jelly would synthesis the associated organic product and then, if in its memory any structure
was created before containing this group would start vibrating, self-assembly would trigger. Not just that, 2 × 5, 2 × 5 × 3,
5 × 3 × 7, all possible compositions would find neighbors and
the integers which have a similar number of compositions of a
set of primes would come together to self-assemble. It is unique,
because the number of compositions is important not the primes
used, 2 × 3 × 7 and 41 × 37 × 47 would be similar. Thus, synthesis of a material analog of a phase prime metric (PPM) (see
Chapter 3 for details) continues spontaneously in the brain jelly
(Strogatz, 2003), until there is a saturation. Coiling and supercoiling of vortex or helical filaments in oscillatory media is
brain jelly’s key bet (Rousseau et al., 1998), it is not electronics,
a superior version of claytronics (Goldstein et al., 2009). A brain
jelly would evolve materials as evolutionary computing (Eiben
and Smith, 2015). It would be read by imaging the optical or
magnetic vortices emitted by brain jelly.

One of the prime questions then arises how does a brain jelly
carry out an intelligent conversation. When input information
enters into the brain jelly as a time crystal, the data acquisition
system in the sensor system acts in a pro-active manner, not like
reading a stream of bits. The brain jelly inspired sensors have to
build a time crystal, hence, instead of a bit as a function of time
they acquire 10 different types of data (see geometric musical language (GML) in Chapter 3). We repeat that brain jelly
sensor acquires a geometric shape made of singularity points,
the clock speed or the rate by which system point changes the
phase, the duration of silence or phase, the rotational direction
of the system point, the noise tolerance that tells the diameter of
the clock, how many distinct channels are there and if there are
inter-channel signal pattern, the imaginary layer interaction,
the relative amplitudes of different clocks as intensity ratios and
the ratio of frequencies as the ratio of primes. These 10 classes
of information were always there in natural interactions, time
crystal-based FIT, the new information theory enables acquiring information content that was never taken into account. Nonlinearly coupled Hamiltonians of a large number of H devices,
they sync and desync to grow dynamically and to deliver thinking for a brain jelly (Gupta et al., 2017).
However, there is an important query that the time crystal
sensor makes, after acquiring the 10 types of row data for the
time crystal. These four queries are to build a linguistic structure. First, what is the slowest clock in a compounded wave
stream, that would be the host clock, in linguistic terms, the
slowest clock is the subject who does the job. Second, what
is the fastest clock, since that would tell linguistically, how
the job is done. Third, the clock that is very sensitive to perturbation is the condition when the job is done, in a linguistic term that is a predicate, and finally the fourth clock that
is least sensitive to perturbation is the answer to the query,
what. The four-layer linguistic query is structured as a quaternion tensor, the data of the time crystal may be a dodecanion or 12D tensor, but, each dodecanion tensor is packed in

253

254

a quaternion tensor as soon as brain jelly acting as a sensor
acquires a data. During entire processing in the brain jelly,
below the quaternion, the structure of information is never
broken.
Magnetic field projected self-assembly: a key to synthesize a PPM in brain jelly: Brain jelly is a gel like liquid made
of a spiral nanowire, that is a fourth-circuit element Hinductor,
H. As said earlier, H builds the magnetic vortices and projects
that field all around as a function of stored charge, it senses
the cavity around it, builds a 3D distribution of potential
centers. It requires 17 key components to build a brain-jellybased humanoid avatar (Figure 9.1). To trigger a PPM synthesis, one has to pump a signal at a particular phase, repeatedly
to an assembly of uniquely arranged oscillators, then they
would activate complex vibrations and synthesis of materials
following PPM (Lewis et al., 1987). Simplest geometric code
is a triangle, three frequency quasi-periodicity could appear
like chaos (Linsay and Cumming, 1989). Therefore, we could
mechanically shake, trigger electromagnetic signal, or even
pump magnetic pulses in a liquid solution of H nanowire or its
gel. Magnetic field pattern in the projected vortices of H from
a few new H devices. This assembly is like a nest that builds
the future cage to hold more H nanowires, and as soon as the
cage is filled with H devices, the output vortex creates the next
version of the field distribution. So, once a seed pattern is written in the solution of H as a nucleus of gel formation, it triggers continuous self-assembly of the H devices. We convert

input data into a universal time crystal using time crystal
analyzer (TCA, Chapter 3), a software module. From time
crystal, one could estimate the possible pattern of H devices,
a seed of H devices that nucleates in the liquid and triggers
spontaneous gel formation. Form a seed we see live the selfassembly of H devices into a giant structure. In a conventional
self-assembly process say a tiny seed of ZnO crystal grows
into a giant structure we see the repetition of the same 1D,
2D, or 3D lattice, over and over again. We may call crystal a
fractal, but that self-similarity is not the case here. Here in the
new kind of self-assembly, the seed structure is not cooked by
the natural material property. Therefore, the geometry of seed
structure is not restricted by the lattice limits found in nature.
Possibilities are infinite. To write a time crystal input, we
create nodes and antinodes in the cavity filled with the brain
jelly, which is a special liquid of organic ligand molecules. As
the time crystal of the information input builds H, first it sets
the geometric parameters of the elements to be synthesized,
i.e., length, pitch, diameter, and lattice of element-assembly.
The instructions are written as vortices of field distribution
in the liquid. Then the H devices come to the vicinity as the
float in the liquid and build the seed lattice. The seed starts
growing following the projected path set by magnetic field
vortices generated by H device and thus follow the PPM as
described in Chapter 3. The growth continues beyond input as
PPM takes the control. The final saturated structure projects
magnetic field distribution as the futuristic dynamics of the

FIGURE 9.1 Brain jelly synthesis process is described step-by-step. The first step is the synthesis of a fourth-circuit element Hinductor
and the last step is to build a humanoid avatar. Inside the spiral pathway, a few Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) images are captured
for the growth of brain jelly.

Brain Jelly to Humanoid Avatar—Fractal Reaction Kinetics, Fractal Condensation, and Programmable Matter

input information, that structure is analogous to an algorithm.
If we want to read output, simply pump electromagnetic signals of different frequencies and 3D temporal dynamics of
output magnetic vortices would contain a series of solutions.
Thus, brain jelly works. The question is why we don’t see a
repetition of the same input lattice as a fractal? The reason is
that the magnetic field projection follows the same method as
we multiply primes to create an integer space in the number
system. Pattern of primes evolve in the integer space, so is the
output of brain jelly. Field projected self-assembly is different
from thermodynamic lattice self-assembly that we see around
us every day.
Frequency fractal hardware = brain jelly: Frequency
fractal is a fractal that may or may not look like a fractal,
but it’s all kinds of resonant oscillations for wide ranges of
activated cavities and dielectric materials filled with wide
ranges of carriers are measured as a function of time, then
one may find self-similarity. The groups of frequencies form
higher periodically oscillating groups, ratio of bandwidths
of groups follow the pattern of primes across the entire frequency range. Dissimilarity is governed by pattern of primes,
this is called frequency fractal. Computing hardware that
would implement a fractal machine would follow the geometric language of primes, where 15 primes and 15 geometric
shapes would rewrite any information content as events in the
universe. The hardware does not care how a system’s materials are arranged, but it cares about the geometric arrangement
of clocks, for the time being in this book the exploration is
limited to 11 imaginary layers, i.e., algebra of dodecanion, a
12D tensor. Information is an 11D time crystal presented as
a quaternion, octonion or dodecanion, the time crystals are
synthesized by manufacturing vortex atoms made of magnetic, electric, ionic, mechanical ripples. The unique material
is named as brain jelly.
The historical background for the soft truly autonomous robotics: When engineers cut objects into pieces and
then reassemble them into the desired product, it is subtractive
engineering. When added liquids, jelly, or diluted materials
are crafted into a pattern, which solidifies into a desired product, it is additive engineering (4D printing Eujin et al., 2017).
For example, recently resin was pumped with electromagnetic fields to convert the desired part of an entire solution in
a 3D object. Apart from fusion of materials (Li et al., 2018)
some researchers are trying fractal condensation to grow and
evolve all parts of an object at a time, continuously, just like
a human body or brain grows from a single cell. Synthesis
of a product spans over a vast length and time scales simultaneously (Rabitz, 2012). Recently multi-level evolution is
being explored (Howard et al., 2019) in an effort to use existing suitable materials or finding a guideline for designing
materials for the next generation robots (Fischer et al., 2018).
It is bottom-up continued automation that designs and edits
the robotic parts across multiple levels of a singular robotic
architecture and transforms them into tasks by accommodating with the environmental conditions. Multi-level evolution
is a concept that proposes to explore the constituent material
building blocks, as well as their assemblies into specialized

255

diverse functional and sensorimotor configurations. Multilevel evolution is to advance industrial production. However,
fractal condensation that is triggered at multiple singularity
points at once in a vibrating material may offer a new type
of evolution. Therein, fractal reaction kinetics (Kopelman
1988) or hierarchical memory in the chemical beaker during
an organic gel-based superstructure synthesis are all parts of
a true multi-level evolution that would spontaneously capture
time crystals as information content from the environment and
evolve the PPM, i.e., the mind of an artificial brain (Barrett,
2011). Thus, most robots are bodies with brains, but here a
time-crystal-based PPM brain would be a brain with bodies
(Meng et al., 2017). Here information content, i.e., time crystal of a given structure runs its clocks which carries out morphological changes in its supramolecular structure (Hauser
et al., 2011). During transformation of geometric shape, the
PPM regulates fundamental changes required to attain symmetry, which in turn triggers continuous self-modeling of the
hardware (Bongard et al., 2006). The construction and operational challenges are plenty for the soft robots (Lipson, 2014;
Rus and Tolley, 1999), yet, they would adapt with environment like living life forms (Cully et al., 2015). Thus, there
is an enormous interest for the development of entirely soft,
autonomous robots (Wehner et al., 2016), to enter into an era
of the evolution of things or real objects from the softwarebased evolutionary computing of the old days (Eiben and
Smith, 2015).
Self-assembled growth of all brain components: Once
the oscillatory equivalents of all 17 organs of the brain are
built, the next task is to combine them together. There are
two major approaches we need to adopt. First, some parts
of an organ should grow by themselves, because we cannot
interfere in the molecular processes, for the same reasons,
which prohibited us to chit-chat with the learning process
and controlling the encoding process of the artificial brain
directly. Second, the majority of organ parts will be constructed through a non-self-assembly process. The reason for
adopting two policies is that with available technology it is
not known how to cook an entire artificial brain in an artificial
womb. We see the design of an artificial brain (Figure 10.1).
There are two parts of this brain architecture, the upper part
is the processing unit, and the lower part replicates the entire
body of a living life form. All five sensory organs, including the touch sensors, arrive, synchronize, and then through
a vertical column it goes up eventually to the brain-stem
region. This vertical column resembles the spinal cord and
the upper spring part replicates the design of an artificial hippocampus. The sensory-signals are not always mixed at the
hippocampus, for example, smell-senses first reach the olfactory cortex, where from the signal is sent to the entorhinal
cortex, where signals from other sensory organs mix and a
fantastic linkage are created, specific to particular individual
and species.
Neuromorphic no more: How are the 17 organs differ:
In the early days’ people used to talk about neuromorphic
devices; now we can argue for protomorphic to build protein
analog and then corticomorphic to build cortical column, etc.,

FIGURE 9.2 A table describes the journey from the old school of neuromorphic devices to the N-morphic devices, where N = 17. There are
five columns, PCMS = PAMAM, controller, molecular rotor, sensor. Oligomer-based various gel synthesis is also part of the multi-morphic
device synthesis. There would be the development of seven sensory devices.

17 such key components are necessary (Figure 9.2). When a
sensory data enters into the brain as a 3D time crystal, the
multi-layered seed material that absorbs the time crystal
resonantly oscillates like a single molecule. The brain jelly
or H-assembly acts like a filter that carries out multilayered
fractal decomposition process as described above. As a result,
all fractal seed-groups in the input time crystal are automatically separated in a multilayered architecture (see the superposition of fractal section for details). Thus, a single image
encoded in a time crystal is itself resembles to an intractable
Clique problem, i.e., the brain jelly has to identify 15 encoded
patterns of GML in an input pattern. When several kinds of
information are linked as time crystal and form a 3D integrated superstructure of time crystals, then PPM sets the rule
of phase transition. Then the geometric structures encoded
in a complex time crystal could be accessed by a brain jelly
through various pathways in the superposition of many pathways. It leads to a very interesting situation. During computation, even at a very local level, at any layer of gel structure,
any subtle noise may select a unique high-density path suggested by PPM, that would change the entire computation

pathway and re-write the whole sequential programming.
H device output, if we measure using a multi-frequency lock-in
amplifier, looks like a stream of waves with different frequencies, whose relative phase relationships change with time
following a different pattern. As noted earlier, time crystal
analyzer reads which frequencies change in groups, when signals become undefined and disappear/appear from detector to
find the continuously changing time crystal. It is how brain
morphic devices are characterized, simultaneously.
How brain morphic devices interact, bond: The PPM
regulated artificial brain cannot operate faster than the time
required to initiate a phase transition of the slowest time
crystal. The system point of a clock that has “one second”
resolution moves to the world with a faster clock say “onemicrosecond” resolution through the singularity; there, one
brain morphic device may encounter another brain morphic
device. System point gets the information into faster morphic devices and returns to the “one-second” resolution world
where to an external observer computing is being performed
with no detectable time lapse in the “one-second” resolution
clock. In simple terms, take input in slower clock domain,

Brain Jelly to Humanoid Avatar—Fractal Reaction Kinetics, Fractal Condensation, and Programmable Matter

send it to a faster clock domain, solve and return it to the
slower clock domain. It is similar to harnessing “negative
time” in quantum mechanics, but instead of one here we have
multiple imaginary worlds, each with different clock speed.
In order to implement the mathematical foundation of several
imaginary numbers (generalized imaginary number, iota or
i2 ~ p, where −1 < p < 0) we can use the fractal mode of
resonance frequency bands and investigate the possibility of
realizing a similar advantage. Different p values suggest different clock-worlds. The materials of a layer are used as a seed
that constructs the next layer; hence, the dynamics of each
layer are totally different. When we probe molecular bonds in
a crystal, the dynamics of crystal and electrons within atoms
do not appear; they become non-existent and thus came the
concept of imaginary spaces. In the 17 brain morphic devices
different feedback protocols act to address different values of
p (Figure 9.2). The generalized imaginary numbers simply
denote different degrees of feedback from nowhere, adding a
feedback function from nowhere for matching the time crystals is a feasible approach.

9.1.1 A Description of Peculiar Designs of Critical
Brain Components Using an Organic Gel
Seventeen brain analogs were selected by studying pattern
of primes in the geometric shapes of all brain components.
An organic synthetic analog for all of the components would
generate a layered composite, which would build a composition of 17 PPMs, a distinct metric for each brain component.
Sahoo et al. have built a new simple technique to synthesis
spirals and their supramolecular assemblies as network of a
gel rapidly in the solution (Sahoo, 2012). The artificial brain
that Singh et al has built is a hybrid device, gel-based supramolecular structure, tiny 3D printed wires, many commercial
nano-sensors, organic and both organic, all were there. Power
was supplied only to the sensors and pumping them to send
the time crystals throughout the humanoid avatar body. Using
EEG on avatar brain they confirmed that signals are passing
through from sensor to the EEG.
Artificial protein (protomorphic device): We get elementary time crystal from a fourth-circuit element, H, but its
operation is fairly limited. In order to sense a complex time
crystal, multiple elements need to arrange such that they have
a different number of loops in the helices, or length. The number of helical loops could be changed according the job
description, it could be any integer series with certain gaps.
The gap follows a rule, the number of rings of participating
H elements follows cyclic rules, e.g., three H elements could
have a number of rings 6–2–6, 5–4–5, four H elements forming an assembly would have rings 3–4–4–3, 6–11–11–6, etc.
These cyclic assembly of elements are generated to manipulate the knots of darkness produced (see Chapter 8 for details)
using different carriers at higher spatial scales. By editing the
number of rings in a spiral, information could be manipulated
in synthetic protein-like materials, 17 brain analogs.
Artificial protein complex (tubulomorphic device):
Microtubule like filaments, ribosomes, several protein

257

complexes carry out important tasks in the information transmission and evolution of a life form. Plenty of spiral nanowires
are available in the literature, produced synthetically or found
in nature. One should neglect many biological features, for
example, dynamic instability of microtubule, and copy information processing features like change in the lattice structure
of proteins on its surface.
Artificial neuron (neuromorphic device): To recall, to
build an artificial neuron, we need multiple distinct symmetries inside a molecular architecture whose dynamics
are associated with the structural relaxation and electronic
transition or conductivity, at the same time, some symmetries should add capabilities that of an antenna. It is possible
if and only if we introduce hierarchical helical architecture.
Then, at the basic structure level, electronic switching would
be programmed in a helix, and in another level we may use
the helices together to construct another basic structure with
which the antenna-like feature is encoded. Transporting carriers through that helix is the next issue. Several spiral nanoarchitectures promise ballistic transport, which is a quantum
effect (Grigorkin and Dunaevskii, 2007). The dimension of
this architecture and electronic properties associated with
the transport of carriers in this material is a crucial factor.
Wire is used in making the spiral assembly of capacitors so
that it charges up and generate magnetic field during energy
transmission; this particular feature turns the material as selfradiating antenna under certain conditions. The crucial point
of magnetic vortex generation is an essential feature of the
artificial neuron design. One could study time crystal based
neural network in a simulator.
(i) Add new neurons, even cluster of neurons, fold brain
cavities as required: The computer is allowed to construct
new neurons as necessary and change its wiring as the situation demands in a software-based neural network. On several
occasions, in order to create a replica of an external time crystal, if a cluster of neurons is required then, an entire cluster
could be generated. The brain simulator is fed with images,
sound, touch, smell, and taste input as 2D patterns as described
above as a function of time. The software automatically creates the neuron firing like stream of pulses and build time
crystal as described in Chapter 2. Sensors build time crystal, thus, store the input images or sounds as rhythms. During
learning, if a rhythm change is required, a new clock is added,
subtracted, rotation direction or diameter of the clock cycle is
changed, modification happens in the time crystal, later the
circuit is changed. The brain organ deforms or folds in its surface even inside the soft computer, when we follow the above
protocol. (ii) The computer sleeps and during that time, local
time crystals, which are wrongly placed at different locations,
are placed at right locations. The computer goes to sleep as
soon as it finds that rhythms are stored in such locations that
are hindering the search and find, spontaneous reply and the
transformation process, as soon as the evaluation, defragmentation, and normalcy restoration is done, returns from sleep
mode. (iii) Self-evaluation, new and better experiment,
virtual neural network evolution: The computer experiments with the circuits, if certain kind of wiring enables it

258

to reconstruct rhythms faster and transformation between
time crystals undergo more efficiently than previous protocols, then it analyses the hardware modification and changes
the virtual neural network fundamentally. (iv) Simulates the
future, analyses multiple routes and then determines the
most suitable ones: The simulator runs feed-forward loops
to evaluate the faster synchronization routes; synchronization
means matching via search and find process. The same could
be realized more profoundly in an organic jelly.
Artificial cortical column (corticomorphic device):
A cortical column has seven layers, surprisingly in the cortex
layer of the brain, the input time crystal enters from the top,
output is generated from bottom part of a cortical column.
A total 29 types of neurons were studied by Singh et al. (2018)
in creating a large variety of cortical columns in the simulator, before organic jelly-based artificial cortical columns were
built. Now, an assembly of H devices that builds neurons, act
as a unit and self-assemble like a cylinder, analogous to a cortical column. Ghosh et al. built similar cylinders using PCMS
(Ghosh, 2015b, 2016b).
Artificial nucleus (nucleomorphic device): As described
in Chapter 7, the nucleus is a nearly spherical or ellipsoidal
assembly of neurons wherein a small region a large number
of symmetries could be encoded. It means, we want to encode
say the PPMs for prime series of 2, 7, 13, 29, the organic
jelly based artificial nucleus would transform the assembly.
However, the same jelly would transform into the prime series
of 3, 13, 31, 43, if required. Now, once according to requirement, the jelly solidifies into a cluster; it remains stable. In the
biological brain, nucleus begins like an empty matrix and
fills up complex functionalities depending on locations and
necessity.
Artificial cranial nerves (craniomorphic device):
Cranial nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system
(12 + 31 = 43), they coordinate sensory input for vital life
actions. Mostly such sensory input to the artificial midbrain
is realized by a typical choice of dielectric materials while
constructing the nerve fiber. The idea is that cranial or spinal
nerves follow C2, C3, C5, and C7 symmetry, and the structural parts of the destination organs or their parts use a similar
symmetry, since they are built by similar dielectric material.
Thus, time crystal transfer without a break.
Artificial spinal cord (spaniomorphic device): The spinal cord is connected to skin nerve network for time crystal input via 31 pairs; additional 31 pairs of motor nerves
run in parallel with the input channel to send action instructions to the body motors. Conducting gel-based spiral, long
fibers are grown around insulating cables to connect sensor
with the analogous spinal cord cavity, built by 3D printing.
Nanomaterials with nano-touch-sensor, pressure sensor, and
thermal sensor properties are mixed together as artificial skin
cells. Each cell connects to conducting fibers. The holes of
spinal cords are self-assembled with gels to connect motor
network and spinal sensory input fibers which run parallel.
Artificial connectome (connectomorphic device):
Connectome architectures are freely available online for 3D
printing. Porous tube-like 0.2 millimeter-thin fibers were

Nanobrain

constructed during 3D printing of connectomes. Porous feature helps in adding organic jelly made of spiral fibers and
build a continuous network of nanofibers to transmit time
crystals from sensors spread all over the body to the brain,
and carry decision time crystals to the brain response system.
Artificial cortex (corteomorphic device): Forty-seven
functional regions suggested by Brodmann are created by
hexagonal close packing of capillary tubes each filled with
seven layers of organic jelly (Ghosh, 2015b). More than
120,000 such columns are distributed over 47 regions to replicate the cortex circuits.
Artificial basal ganglia (basalomorphic device): Basal
ganglia has 13 sub-components, using organic jelly similar
supramolecular architectures are grown in the 13 tiny 3D
printed cavities. The ratio of resonance frequencies follow
patterns made of primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.
The artificial brain stem (stemomorphic device): Brain
stem is created with 17 nuclei, each specialized to process
particularly prime-based metrics described in Chapter 3.
Artificial thalamus (thalamorphic device): Since fundamental drives are to be programmed here, very basic geometric controls are encoded here in all operational time domains,
so that irrespective of the time crystal generated in the artificial brain thoughts, particular geometric integration or grouping is forcefully imposed.
Artificial hippocampus (hippomorphic device): During
the search and find a process, the resource and encoder
antenna in the artificial hippocampus should remain pristine;
to save their information purity we introduced two bufferantennas for internal communication. Similarly, the hierarchical antenna could itself get modified while implementing
the rules of transformation on the upper brain time crystalcluster, so it requires another buffer antenna. The time crystal
transformation process is the most critical part of the artificial
brain operation, it should be a standalone process controlled by
two more antennas independent of both artificial hippocampus and artificial forebrain. The process requires two buffer
antennas to take input from higher brain and resource antenna
and send output to the resource buffer antenna. Therefore,
four giant organic antennas operate simultaneously (cingulate
gyrus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and fornix); higher-level
rules are superimposed on the input time crystal cluster to
govern search and find process without disruption from any
operation in the brain. These antennas are called “transformation antenna.” To summarize, the artificial brain is embedded
with two layers of tiny antennas inside every single neuron,
then there are four pairs of antennas—resource antenna pair,
encoder antenna pair, hierarchical antenna pair, dual transformation antenna pair.
Artificial cerebellum (cerebellomorphic device):
Cerebellum is mostly a fractal architecture within a selected
cavity as described in Chapter 7. For cerebellum there should
be two fractal architectures—one propagate horizontally and
the other vertically. In the central region two supramolecular architectures crossover. Two orthogonal fractals naturally
synchronize wide ranges of time domain signals as singular
coherent output time crystal.

Artificial hypothalamus (hypomorphic device):
Processes time crystals similar to the thalamus. However, one
additional geometric feature is added here, virus-like geometric codes as tiny isolated time crystals, propagate throughout
the system, wherever there is a match, forms a bond by adding a linking clock. Thus, the drive for a particular desire is
programmed as movable time crystal in the supramolecule,
desire is also a time crystal filtering process during synthesis
of decision-making time crystal and learning.
The artificial limbic system (limbomorphic device):
For 3D printing high-energy radiating materials are used to
build a receiver and an antenna operating together. Cortical
column or hippocampus (both have same architecture H3),
inspires the core structure design of every single brain
component.
Artificial blood vessels (mechanomorphic device):
Blood vessels generate mechanical rhythms in the brain with
heart beats in the biological brain. The five-fold and sevenfold symmetric structure of blood vessel network are 3D
printed using elastic materials (only for the brain, we neglect
blood vessels of the body) that vibrate like the real network in
the brain when resonated by ultra-sound pumping.
Filtering the slower distinct yet time crystals in the
upper brain or cortex: Two major antennas are there in the
artificial brain—cingulate gyrus and fornix. The basic core
part of the midbrain interacts with the higher-level information processing parts located in the pre-frontal cortex, PFC.
In terms of time crystals, PFC analogue hardware analyzes
how very slow rhythms are given highest priority in the
organic nano brain and brain-jelly-based brain. We return to
the neural network of the artificial brain, where due to the
continuous transmission of time crystals from the resourceantenna, smaller and larger size time crystals are being constructed. The associated expansion of active rhythms or time
crystals via PPM is noted as self-assembly of time crystals.
These time crystals are a replica of the quantized time crystals created in the helix resource-antenna RBA, the hardware
analogues of gyrus and fornix. Some of these time crystals
might be already existing in the brain, some of them were
coupled with them during old experiences also get excited.
Thus, the size or the number of clocks/rhythms of in the
emerged time crystal-cluster increases, this process generates several slow rhythms built to link the participating time
crystals. Therefore, resultant time crystal-pattern spreads all
over the neural network of the upper brain, or artificial cortex.
To make sure about the new time crystals, a cyclic update
scheme runs: resource antenna ↔ upper brain ↔ resource
buffer ↔ encoder buffer ↔ encoder antenna ↔ upper brain.
A few cycles in this loop creates an equilibrium of input time
crystal cluster in the upper brain.
The supreme role of the virtual forebrain and hierarchical antenna: At this point, the higher-level brain or forebrain, which holds the convergence rules or slowest rhythms
activates, acts like an antenna (hierarchical antenna HRA subroutine) that transforms the expanded input-time crystals into
more symmetric 3D architecture of clocks via a pair of transformation antenna to be described in the latter part of this

259

chapter. In the majority of the morphogenesis of input time
crystal, the transformation process in the higher brain, PFC,
drastically shrinks the size of the input-time crystals-cluster.
Actually, the higher-level brain simply stores from the experiences as “transformation rule,” i.e., identifies what kinds of
complex decisions we took for similar situations, under the
similar time crystals, and simply try to impose that in the current given scenario. The “transformation rule” are time crystals that is built to link particular patterns of integers in the
PPM. As transformation continues and equilibrium is established, the new sets of time crystals are sent to the resourcebuffer antenna for identification of the differences between
the input and transformed time crystals. The uniqueness or
time crystal that could directly generate the transformed time
crystal by higher brain with the help of PPM is identified
and returned to the upper brain for permanent storage and
the associated rule is sent back to the higher brain (an analogue of human forebrain to be precise) via encoder antenna.
A hierarchical loop antenna ↔ upper brain ↔ resource buffer ↔ encoder buffer ↔ encoder antenna continues until equilibrium is reached, i.e., morphogenesis of time crystal ceases
to expand. Input time crystal cluster creation loop and transformation loop do not conflict since the later operates actively
only after the first loop reaches equilibrium.
The dual role of encoder antenna: The encoder antenna
thus performs two vital jobs at a time, the storing of permanent memory via delicate filtering and triggering higher-level
logical rules, or hierarchical antenna simultaneously. When
new rules are stored in the forebrain or associated parts of
hierarchical antenna, it is called “learning,” and the difference
between the input time crystals coming from the environment
and the output time crystals coming from upper brain is the
creative decision, constructed in the resource buffer antenna.
The shrinking of largely expanded time crystals in the upper
brain is intelligence. Unlike conventional brain builders the
intelligence and creativity are strictly defined parameters in
the hardware, thus tunable at will, the output solution is captured from the resource buffer antenna.

9.2 A HEXAGONAL 2D SHEET OF CORTICAL
COLUMNS—A CARPENTER’S JOB
How the artificial brain decides wherein the actual system changes need to be made for self-assembling the time
crystals: The necessity of beating: During resonance, if two
frequency points are nearby, then a new phenomenon is generated in the hardware; this is called “beating.” It causes a
unique ripple effect in the localized neighborhood. The beating effect identifies the exact location of the hardware needs
to be changed and how much changes are required to nullify
the beating effect. In a real human brain this beating effect
would identify which neuron needs to be changed, those
would change structure and re-orient by firing, just like rockets maneuver in space. It is the hardware mechanism of selfassembly of time crystals. Beating is taken care of by four
PPMs running in parallel.

9.2.1 The Collective Response of Quad
Patterns of Primes
Development of 17 different brain components requires 17
PPMs. Figure 9.3a outlines four different metrics similar to
the one we described for modeling the human brain. However,
a generic engineering perspective is shown here. Four different metrics are PPM-1: sensor data collection center. PPM-2:
sensory data integration. PPM-3: Sensory network compilation 8D, 12D. PPM-4: Higher level dynamics. Each metric has
three parts. First, integer composition metric, prime composition metric and prime gap metric (see Chapter 3 for details).
Seventeen brain components do not belong to sensor class,
not just PPM-1, but they all need PPM-2 and PPM-3. Only
the cortex part is made of PPM-4. Now the most important
concern, how to build the simplest and the most elementary
device of the brain (H3, see Chapter 8) from which constituents of all seventeen brain analogues could be produced.
There are two key features one has to take into account while
building the artificial organ. First, the selection of materials,

all materials in the brain would be made of H or Hinductor

behavior (Figure 9.3b).
A journey to darkness is not a sin; it’s transcendence to
a pure and a perfect thought: To fold the brain from dinosaur to human, nature took 65 million years. One could say,
given that time, we could produce an artificial brain by evolving the existing computer. We have a concern about the fate
of algorithmic computing. We have mentioned earlier that by
old Turing theory, we can melt the entire universe into a single
thread of bits. However, when we change the worldview that
the universe is an architecture of clocks, each clock holding
a geometric shape within and above, then the dynamic links
undefined paths. We want to make a device, introduce a new
kind of processing that helps in finding a simple topology in a
rapidly changing big data. Imagine that you are in a room and
zillions of multi-colored light patterns with a high gradient of
intensities, and the patterns are randomly changing. Currently,
a scientist would look at a petaflop supercomputer, to simulate
the equations explaining the gradient of field intensity. Instead

of looking into the gradient of colored light, we can look into
the dark lines, where there is no light. Inequality relation held
by a group of dark lines reveals the geometric structure stored
by the system. A little grammar book can help us read the
geometric shapes hidden in a few dark lines. A massive complex pattern that rapidly changes with time would become a
few vibrating dark lines. Consequently, the brain or elementary biological decision-making machine is now an example
of perturbation engineering that harvests signal from noise
using resemblance with 15 geometric shapes (GML). In each
device, two complementary symmetry breaking modules
would operate against each other to harvest noise, and thus
produce scalar and vector clocks which are used as elementary free electromagnetic particle-like structures, vortex.
There are two types of structures. One type of structure gives
nested geometric shapes, another is used for communication
through singularity points in the undefined domain of resonant oscillations. It is utmost essential that we learn the simplest generic device (H3) that could alone be an essential and
sufficient element to build an artificial brain. The question is
to start from neuron or α-helices, for a bottom-up synthesis of
an artificial brain.
The question is at which dimension should we start
building the organic brain? When we reduce the size of the
nanoparticles, beyond a certain limit fundamental physics
laws do not work, the particle becomes a liquid. Scaling at
spatial and temporal scale in the small nano-structures follow
unique geometric rules (Landman, 2005). The only way to
begin brain construction is to synthesize 2–10 nm size protein, or supramolecule with a flexible design. When helical
structures representing protein self-assemble into a neural
network like brain jelly, by adopting helical, vortices and
fractal geometries, one could avoid nanoscale engineering
problems. The smallest device is a trilayer helix Hinductor,
H; as explained in Chapter 7, and its physics are detailed in
Chapter 8. H device alone is not used in the brain, several
H makes H2, and several H2 makes H3. Finally, H3 undergoes morphogenesis to create brain components. And all 17
components are supramolecular architectures of H3 class
(Figure 9.3c).
Design and synthesis protocol for a generic Hinductor
device H3 as sensor, processor, and memory: Doping a
desired element in a system can be initiated and primed using
a resonance process. Let’s learn how. Standing waves combined with electrochemical reaction along a tube would precisely define where the ions would tag. The capacitor spacing
in a cylindrical cavity is therefore realized by standing wave
of ion vapor, the standing wave on helical nanotube is the
matrix. Dopant electrostatically attracted to the maxima of
a standing wave. We make three similar concentric helices,
one above another. The surface lattice parameters and other
geometric parameters described above govern the patterns
of knots of darkness generated by monochromatic light falling on its surface, surface manipulation would regulate the
dynamics of magnetic rings and other artificial atom like
structures. The geometry of a higher-level structure uses
the vortex of light and the knots of darkness produced by

261

a lower helical layer as elementary field distribution when
pumped with a cluster of energy to harness. Thus, we can
build bottom-up architectures. A sensor, processor and a
memory element are similar self-assembled architectures of
Hinductor. The only difference is that a sensor is designed
to use a given set of signals for interference, for an eye it
is light, for ear it is sound, etc, an assembly is dedicated to
sensing only particular type of signals. For a processor, the
key design has a supreme objective, increase the number of
symmetries a structure could process, means increase the
PPM bandwidth as much as possible. For memory, the structure is designed so that different local parts process distinct
isolated domains of PPM, so that identity of time crystals
are preserved.

9.2.2 Electric, Magnetic, and Mechanical
Rhythms Bind Them
The brain cannot be a quantum device, cannot be electromagnetic device either: Complementary coexistence
of vortex atoms and solitons: Under salty water, the electromagnetic waves cannot transmit. Under massive thermal
fluctuation, the quantum wavefunctions for a material cannot survive entanglement. So, two options are left, one build
solitons and or vortices. The vortex atoms are like ripples
created by a drop of rain on the water surface, while solitons
are loss-less transport of that vortex through a canal. Vortex
could be made of various carriers, magnetic field ripple could
make magnetic vortex, electric field ripple may build an electric vortex, mechanical oscillation could make mechanical
vortex. Since the vortex structures are like atoms, all types of
vortices can build composite material in liquid, which could
pass through a noisy environment. In the artificial brain, we
deal with two kinds of solitons—first electronic, and second
phononic in nature. Solitons need ordered architecture to
flow; together solitons or quasi particles and vortex atoms
complete the story, one masters the loss-less transmission
through liquid and the other through a solid. The division into
multiple packets and then resurgence into a new form is possible as neurons and its clusters continuously switch among
multiple allowed symmetries. As argued earlier, a canal like
a path in the neural network of the artificial brain by spontaneously polymerizing the molecular machines, which makes
sure to transport information without losing much energy,
therein zig-zag paths are roads for solitons (Christiansen,
1997). A synchronize call to capture a particular kind of
information from all around the artificial brain would follow
generating electronic and phonon soliton in the solid structure and vortices in liquid and open space. While electronic
solitons carry the information to the distant locations, phonon
solitons deal with the noise and keep the purity of the signal
intact. This is why Figure 9.3b has a unique significance in
brain construction, e − π − φ resonance behavior. The typical
electric e, magnetic ϕ, and mechanical π resonance frequencies coupled together helps in the synthesis of time crystals
made of magnetic particles (magnetic and electrical vortices,
Chapter 8). After all no one would dare to make a chemical

262

brain at least in this century, who would feed it, who would
build releasing excretion. The flux-charge route is neat and
clean, brain needs no food, does not have to excrete. The electric e, magnetic ϕ, and mechanical π resonance work together
by non-linear frequency pulling.
Synchronization by non-linear frequency pulling:
Crude analogy of extreme non-linear pulling is falling onto a
black hole, but in synchrony it is sharing (Cross et al., 2004).
In recurrent networks asynchronous processes can mediate
inhibition leading to synchronization process, therefore, both
the processes can interchange between themselves (Marella
and Ermentrout, 2010). The size of synchronizing clusters
is an interesting issue, networks with fixed degrees of freedom synchronize faster than random arrangement (Grabow
et al., 2010), a small geometric group of a network exhibits
high local clustering and low average path length, as a result
they synchronize extremely fast (Watts and Strogatz, 1998).
Advocates of randomness may continue to endorse magic.
Synchronization between electrical, mechanical, and magnetic rhythms have been an intricate relationship historically.
A fusion of two or more kinds of resonances has enormous
applications.
One type of resonance should be measured with other
types of resonances: By now, since the story of simultaneous
electric, magnetic, and mechanical resonances are returning
as e − π − φ identity time and again in the book, readers are
wondering who is running the artificial brain, the diagonal
drivers of quaternion, octonion, and dodecanion or the triplet
identity. The answer is both are opposite sides of the same
coin. The diagonal drivers are a pair of diagonal elements of
the respective tensors, which have identical values. That identity is preserved by e − π − φ driver. In order to realize the
brain jelly, we need to characterize every single organic helical
nanostructure and its assembly, at all scale, all layers should
hold the identity at all time. Measurement of resonance for any
forces is not straightforward. In 1964, Alzetta and Gozzini
(1964, 1967) argued that to measure the magnetic resonance,
the mechanical resonance of that element should be probed.
It took nearly 30 years to recognize that mechanical detection
of magnetic resonance is a reliable technique (Rugar et al.,
1992). Within seven years, the proposals were made for simultaneously measuring the magnetic, electric, and mechanical
resonances (Alzetta et al., 1999). These adventures started
in the 1970s when people were crazy about quantum nondemolition measurement or the type of measurement which
measures but do not destroy the quantum state. These journeys were for detecting the gravitational wave using quantum
measurement by evading back action. These measurements
were about keeping a magnetic particle on the mechanically
vibrating atomic force microscope tip, which starts vibrating with the magnetic resonance. Bandyopadhyay et al. used
polarized optical laser and observed magnetic vortices which
delivered a composition of vortex atoms as a signature of time
crystals in various synthetic organic brain analogs as a precursor to building a hybrid organic brain. The collective wisdom of brain-building discussed above for 17 components is
summarized again in Figure 9.3d.

9.3 ANOMALOUS QUANTUM
CLOAKING—VANISHING AND
SEEING THE ONE WE WANT TO
Theories of quantum cloaking suggested that the current of the
probability density, in a matter-wave following Schrödinger’s
equation behaves like an electromagnetic wave in Maxwell’s
equation. Two critical features of an electromagnetic wave,
the displacement of electric-magnetic vectors and the field
density (Poynting vector, P) hold their form even after a coordinate transformation. The invariance, a key to classical cloaking (Figure 9.4a), required a quantum analog, so the Poynting
vector was replaced by the current of the probability density,
and the displacement vector was replaced by a dispersion
relation. As described in Chapter 8, to build magnetic vortexlike particles we need symmetrically distinct distribution of
charge as shown in Figure 9.4a using examples A, B, C, and
D. Some of these patterns provide negative refractive index,
which is used to create superposition of circuits made of H is
by making some of the active decision-making H elements
vanished during computation. That enables us to build circuit
with no wiring of components. One problem with the existing Maxwell-Schrödinger analogy for quantum cloaking is
that two parameters, the effective mass m* and the ­potential V
from isolated distinct parts of a matter wave should bend and
follow strict paths to bypass the material and re-join similar to
a classical cloaking. Moreover, entanglement in a matter wave
demands ultralow temperature for a noise free environment.
For an electromagnetic wave, the anisotropic space and time
ensures that distinct rays return to their original trajectory
after bending through the object-to-hide, but it is quantum
analog is not clear.
One has to find a general protocol to convert a material
into a composition of superlens (negative refractive index).
Then, a matter wave could tunnel through a material, at ambient atmosphere as it happens routinely in the quantum optics
experiment through an optical lens. Not all material be suitable for that. Milton argued for a special material, where the
elements in a composite, collectively resonate, thus affect far
beyond their boundary. In the spiral or vortex shape composites (Panfilov et al., 1985), we discovered a unique 3D phase
space of energy transmission that enables selectively converting an element of the composite into a superlens and tunnel a matter wave from the atomic flat surface through that
lens. Singularities or holes in the phase space of transmission across a vortex is encoded in the geometric parameters of
helix or vortices that act as the quantum analog for the anisotropic space and time found in a classical cloaking. Tunneling
through a superlens often extracts a 2D or 3D matter wave
hidden deep inside a cloaking material, superpose it on the
regenerated matter wave. Superlensing is often attributed to
anomalous local resonance. Degenerate states of H devices
with distinct geometric phases hold a time crystal (Pistolesi
and Manini, 2000); the system is non-adiabatic as two distinct
dynamics runs without affecting each other.
Matter cloaking could be achieved by controlling the
potential and the effective mass as a particle travels through a

media (Zhang et al., 2008; Greenleaf et al., 2008) and making
it invariant under a coordinate transformation. The problem
was first noted by Milton and Nicorovici (2006). Since electromagnetic wave following Maxwell’s equations is invariant under coordinate transformation it was never a difficult
thing. For quantum, general time-dependent case there is no
invariant transformation, so researchers take quantized 3D
potentials as coordinates (Vx, Vy, Vz), instead of spatial coordinates (x, y, z), it turns matter waves like a Poynting vector,
which becomes invariant under coordinate transformation
(Tsang and Psaltis, 2007). Existing quantum cloaking theories use a potential that considers beyond a certain distance
potential is zero, thus, the emergence of cloaking is decided
even before the derivation begins. Another route is canceling the scattering when matter wave moves (Fleury and Alu,
2013). Eliminating the scattering by resonating the boundary
wall of a cavity reminds us the membranes and multilayered

structures in biology (Ramm et al., 1996). The ultimate goal
for everybody is to reduce the scattering cross-section of carriers to zero. It has been shown that more is the core-shell
layer, better is the push-pull of carriers and more is the degradation in scattering (Lee and Lee, 2013).
However, the idea to build an elementary description of quantum cloaking begins from Schrödinger’s equations (Jelinek
et al., 2011). The similarity between the Schrödingers equation and Maxwell’s equation has been a subject of interest for
decades, this analogy is already noted above. However, thus
far no reports exist on the experimental verification of quantum cloaking, one route could be taking quantum tunneling
images of the object, and showing them vanishing under the
tunneling current images. Theoretically calculating tunneling
image is done by scattering calculation (Corbel et al., 1999).
Under the electromagnetic wave, when the evanescent
wave is amplified, near-perfect tunneling could happen.

264

This proposal was the first in quantum tunneling (Baena
et al., 2005) and was an extrapolation of Pendry’s idea that
if both electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are
negative in a medium ( ε = −1; µ = −1) , we get a superlens,
or perfect lens (Pendry, 2000). It means the positioning of
a set of interconnected photons or pointing vectors on the
other side of the lens. If the material surface is anisotropic, then the dielectric constant is negative, if the surface
is non-spherical (e.g., cylinder), then dielectric loss tends to
zero, entire signal tries to pass through, we get anomalous
dielectric resonance (Ammari et al., 2013). One of the beautiful aspects of anomalous dielectric resonance is that if the
charge density distribution is near to the lens where the information is being transferred, then evanescent wave amplifies
and makes signal loss nearly to zero (Meklachi et al., 2016).
It is the criterion for cloaking and sincerely followed while
designing four circuit element Hinductor. One experimental evidence of quantum cloaking is shown in Figure 9.4b,
for calf-thymus DNA, which is a fourth-circuit element due
to triple helix, two molecular, one made of water. We have
made microtubule, collagen, and several biological helices
and our synthetic helical gels partially vanish component by
component by choosing suitable frequencies, which we call
anomalous quantum cloaking.

9.3.1 Randomness Is Not Random Anymore
To build the brain what should one do? Take a chemical beaker or 3D printed cavity and add all ingredients? Figure 9.4c
explains how the most primitive brain jelly could be synthesized and be operated. Brain’s neural network has three
elements—neuron, glial cells, and extracellular matrices. Using
H2 devices that are analogous to neurons, nanobrain, or PCMS
that is analogous to neurons or glial cells (Ghosh et al., 2015a,
2015b), a polymer-based organic gel matrix is synthesized that
a builds 3D neural network of multi-scale helical structures.
If they are mixed in the solution, and time crystal is given
as input using electromagnetic signals of various frequencies
using antenna from outside, the organic materials would read
time crystals, mimic analog material and continue to grow.
By applying the monochromatic laser light and semiconductor
camera one could read the output time crystal projected to a
magnetic film and captured by a semiconductor camera.
What happens when a brain jelly learns? In the 3D polymeric matrix that often used for 3D cell culture, the pores that
hold H, H2, and H3 devices reconstruct and rearrange to hold
modified time crystals, one such situation is shown schematically in the Figure 9.4d. Note that the entire matrix, grown
from nano to the meter scale while emulating the input time
crystal follow the coupled electric, mechanical, and magnetic
resonance (Figure 9.5a). Solution to gel (sol-gel) conversion
and then growing into a massive architecture is rapid, the process time is fixed, irrespective of complexity of time crystals,
it varies seconds to minutes. Moreover, earlier, such processes
were extensively used for building the neural network, which
is just opposite to the kind of neural network discussed in
this book (Figure 9.5a and b). Note that when the elementary

Nanobrain

structures grow, those are strictly helix (Figure 9.5c); however, when they grow, vortex or PPM-driven fractal-like
architectures take over, they don’t look like spiral, but vortices of various kinds. One could show that angular momentum
is singular parameter that could change to generate all kinds
of vortices.
Electrical, magnetic and mechanical cloaking for
e − π − φ quadratic engine: Regarding resonance one of
the beautiful concepts that raised was “time-harmonic” in
mechanical cloaking or elastic cloaking devices. Mechanical
cloaking means to an outsider, it would appear as if the
mechanical wave is passing through a homogeneous media,
though it passes through an object (Milton et al., 2006).
There could be current sources for which outside the
source, an electric and magnetic field is zero (Afanasiev and
Dubovik, 1998). Maxwell noted that a torus with a constant
poloidal current flowing on its surface would have poles in
contact, i.e., invisible from outside (Maxwell, 1890). When
multi-­layered core-shell architecture of H is the foundation
of higher-dimensional structures, it is said that for four layers one top of another, we get quaternion tensor. For eight
layers, growing above and below, we get octonion tensor.
Nicorovici et al. introduced the concept that in a bilayer coreshell structure the upper layer adds a phase value to the inner
core, so the dielectric constant is −1 + δ (Nicorovici et al.,
1994). Now, if the bilayer is extended to duo-deca layers,
each layer with a new phase, then the partially resonant component achieves the ability to process a dodecanion tensor,
i.e., becomes a brain jelly. Several examples of brain jelly are
shown in Figure 9.5b–i.

9.4 A LIVING GEL THAT LISTENS AND
THEN GROWS FROM ATOMIC
SIZE TO CENTIMETERS LONG
Background of current gel research: One interesting feature of the ferroelectric property is that most materials additionally shows piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses.
Figure 9.5f–h shows PCMS or nano brain-based nanowires
that exhibit such properties. Ferroelectric polymers have polar
groups at the backbone, so holds a permanent electric polarization that could be reversibly switched under the electric
field. Ferroelectric polymers (Nalwa, 1995; Lovinger, 1983),
such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has an inherent
piezoelectric response, consequently they are used in acoustic transducers and electromechanical actuators (Figure 9.5b).
However, due to their inherent pyroelectric response, they are
used as heat sensors (Furukawa, 1989). Hydrogels could be
mixed to generate such a compounded property, for example,
here in Figure 9.5i, carbon nanotube, nanobrain or NB, or
PCMS and polymeric gel were mixed similar to Figure 9.4c,
one could feel how brain jelly looks like. Examples are there
in the pieces of literature, e.g., a mixture of carbon nanotube
and polymer hydrogel (Qu et al., 2008). Certain physical
stimuli like electric field, light and temperature or chemical stimuli like concentration of certain molecules or ions
could initiate phase transition in the material which could

result in the changes in volume, mechanical electrical magnetic or even the structural symmetry, these are called stimuli
responsible gels, and their major application is in building
actuators (Ali et al., 2016; Richter et al., 2007; Gerlach and
Arndt, 2009). Electrostrictive graft polymers have a flexible
backbone chain wherein each monomer contains branching
side chains (Figure 9.4a). In an assembly, the side chains of
the neighboring backbone polymers cross-link and the linked
unit cell builds the crystal encompassing the entire assembly. The backbone and side-chain crystal units have dipole
moment with partial charges (Wang et al., 2004). Gels that
are used for 3D cell culture breaks and recreates bonds to give
space to the growing cells (Tibbitt and Anseth, 2009). When
spiral helices made of gels grow as Hinductor or H devices,
on many occasions it would be essential to make mesoscale

structural changes (Usher et al., 2015). Such local changes
are essential for continued brain jelly evolution as a means to
deliver plasticity in learning new concepts or behaviors.
Atomic to centimeters scale brain jelly is a e − π − φ
resonator: Electrical patterns of brain jelly are continuously
monitored by EEG, and they resembles that of premature
babies, the work resembles with the works of biological minibrain (Trujillo et al., 2018). Not only understanding the evolution of the brain, one of the prime applications of brain jelly
would be brain-computer interface, a biological evolutionary
recovery after stroke (Biasiucci et al., 2018). Artificial organ
development has reached nearly to a point where adding the
dedicated time crystal of a living system would enable natural
healing of wounded organs (e.g., artificial skin Nieves, 2016).
Evolving gel is a must to build a living brain, because gels

266

have unique properties of self-healing, erasing and rebuilding new structures, which would be the best choice to achieve
perception-based plasticity in learning in an artificial neural
network. To develop a mechanical sensor, it is easy to adopt
elastomeric gels (Christoph et al., 2010), by mixing it with the
electroactive gels one could build artificial muscle (Randy,
2008). Eventually a brain jelly would be an e − π − φ resonator (Figure 4.15), whose electrical, mechanical and magnetic resonances are in a quadratic relationship (e 2 + φ 2 = π 2 ),
while evolving H circuit. Evolution means, when time crystals representing small functional components follows the
quadratic relationship, interact by a collective dynamic time
crystals propagating around and builds the composite time
crystal (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) by bringing astronomically
large number of H devices in groups (Shiino and Frankowicz,
1989). Even in the composite time crystal quadratic relationship holds. To hold the quadratic relationship, the small
spirals acting as Hinductor or H arrange in the helical gel
(Veretennikov et al., 2002; Lin et al., 2017; Celli et al., 2009;
Kennedy et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2014) in a chaotic order
and wirelessly communicate (Jaeger and Haas, 2004), using
magnetic vortex atoms, or ionic vortex, or electrical vortex
or mechanical vortex. When these vortices travel through the
solid materials pathway, they appear like a non-interactive
soliton or quasi-particle and when in the open space, or liquid,
they are like free particles like vortices or knots of darkness
but interactive.
Persistence and self-affinity in PPM metric: PPM as
the basin of attractor (all dynamics tend to converge to a particular section of PPM 3D patter) that guides self-assembly,
synchronization, drives computing, and decision-making
is a journey through the 3D basin of attractor if a cellular
automaton like pattern evolution triggers in the brain jelly. As
described in this book, basin of the attractor for nanobrain
is a 3D sphere-shaped map consisting of several dynamic
points, each point is a time crystal in a quaternion, octonion
or dodecanion tensor, and the entire map represents a complex
relationship between different dynamic states of the cellular
automaton system that the system builds. Two parameters
are important here. One, persistence, which means that in a
time series or time fractal (infinite chain of clocks in a time
crystal), large values (slow clock) are followed by a large
value and small values (faster clocks) are followed by a small
value, a crossover to uncorrelated behavior happens on the
larger time scales. Self-similarity, sometimes parameterized
as self-affinity correlates two or more time crystals, now, the
correlations change with time, sometimes it is fast, e.g., an
exponential decay in correlation, it is called short-term correlation and some times it is so long that characteristic time
scale cannot be defined (power law exponent is between 0 and
1), it is called long-term correlation. When two time crystals
exchange small subsets of time crystals, the standard deviation of data exchange changes with time, this is called non-­
stationarities. Considering the increments ∆xi = xi − xi −1 of a
self-affine series ( xi ), i = 1, 2, 3… N , N is measured equidistant in time, ∆xi could either be persistent, independent, or
anti-persistent. For stationary data with constant mean and

Nanobrain

standard deviation the auto-covariance function of the increments, C ( s) = ∆xi ∆xi + s = 1/( N − s)∑iN=1− s ∆xi ∆xi + s , so we can
directly calculate even the elementary time crystal exchange
parameters during computing (Kantelhardt, 2011).
Whenever brain jelly encounters a new problem, this
will be a new path in the spherical basin of attractor, and
the neighboring system of oscillators would try to accommodate that new path component by modifying its existing
dynamic points in the 3D world. Euclidian traveling salesman
problem because in the 3D space we have several existing
dynamic points of basin of attractor and any problem given
to nanobrain is converted into a line of sequential evolution
of dynamic points and the first task of this nanobrain is to
match this new situation with the inherent dynamic map of
the system, that has been constructed before solving the problem. Since PPM is basin of attractor, jelly requires no training.
Now, nanobrain has to find dynamically closest points in the
already existing basin of attractor map of a cellular automaton, and moreover, it has to find a way to move from new point
to each option individually, and then find the shortest route.
Next step for the computation would be creating another new
dynamic point, which means a new grid, made of new states
of the participating neuron-oscillators. The objective of creating the new point would be that a journey from that new point,
would lead to all the neighboring points faster than the previous point set by the problem. The particular criterion makes
the problem intractable, brain jelly as its savior.
Complexity can increase without acquiring infinite
resource: Brain jelly synthesis follows chemistry beyond
Chemical Kinetics: Inside the organic brain made of folded
2D sheets of H3 devices or hexagonal close packed cortical columns, the wireless circuits made of H devices always evolve,
the neuron analog H1 changes communication pathway and
the gel replicates this feature in the artificial brain to create a
time crystal architecture. The time crystal structures transform
to follow the symmetry linking guidelines set by the PPM.
The particular feature helps the brain jelly to create higher-level
intelligence. For example, the jelly can perceive that a banyan
tree looks like ice cream from a far distance, (mm), therefore,
the co-existence of multiple grouping and continuous creation
and destruction of its pathway helps brain-hardware to increase
the time bandwidth of the time crystal via simple changes in the
connection i.e., the geometry of H3 arrangement. It is important to note that the journey to all kinds of brain jelly begins at
a single molecular scale. Take for example, Ghosh et al. synthesized PCMS shown in Figure 9.6b, its different parts act as
a different molecular seed, that would eventually unfold into
various complex architectures. For all brain jelly, a seed nanostructure needs to be created that grows by itself from 7 nm to
a large jelly like structure step-by-step, the growth does not follow the path of chemical kinetics, there is no chemical reaction, rather, phase transitions from one symmetry to another.
The jelly-like structure replicates the time crystal storage and
processing information like a neural network, so we call it brain
jelly. The entire brain-jelly-derived supramolecule acts like a
fractal of oscillators (fibrillar structure forms at a critical frequency; Swain and Valley, 1970), derives a large time crystal

under the exposure of monochromatic light. If one opens, millions of oscillators would be found inside; if one takes one
of them would find millions of oscillators inside, the journey
continues. The entire journey could be represented in terms
of clocks inside a clock; however, it does not matter how the
material or oscillators arrange, what matters is how their representative clocks arrange. We have listed in Figure 9.6b several brain jelly whose journey started at the single molecular
scale, but eventually they produced suitable structures for using
them in the tiny cavities of 17 brain analogs listed in the table
of Figure 9.2. Finally, the brain of humanoid avatar looks like
Figure 9.6c, this is an integrated commercial version of the final
architecture.

9.5 FRACTAL CONDENSATION—
CONDENSING EVERYWHERE AT ONCE
Then there were two more classes of manufacturing waiting
in the lab desk, self-assembly, and fractal condensation. Selfassembly was proposed in 1988 and fractal reaction kinetics
and related condensation were proposed in 2016 (Ghosh et al.,

2016b). Self-assembly is found to be limited because it requires
materials in a particular form and elementary structure to proceed. While fractal condensation is a brilliant way of putting
it, whenever “fractal” word includes in the formation of any
structure, self-assembly from a nucleus by core-shell growth
and then self-assembly of several such nuclei run simultaneously. Until now the grammar of fractal manufacturing noted
above is not established, but, one could use number system
and the pattern of primes to regulate the growth process. If
manufacturing follows the pattern of primes, it will never be
left alone, no need to program and self-healing would be fundamental to it. For self-healing, a “fractal-based” structure
is always the best choice. In the Bose-Einstein condensation,
one wave function holds many atoms, if we add more, wave
function remains intact (Figure 9.7a). In the fractal condensation, there are plenty of available singularity domains where
phase gets undefined. If we add new time symmetry it gets
adsorbed in suitable singularity domains and still singularity
survives. Why? Readers know by now, that within a single
singularity point, a massive dodecanion tensor could reside,
after all they grow in the nested imaginary worlds.

Definition of condensation at far from equilibrium:
The condensate (Jochim et al., 2003; Fröhlich, 1968a, 1968b)
class materials follow a unique materials science philosophy;
continuous additions of similar atoms do not change properties of the condensate, while dissimilar atoms find their way
inside the same structure acquiring distinct symmetries and
delivering unique properties. If atoms are replaced by molecules, a fusion of suitable new molecules to the condensate
would add desired functionalities, keeping properties of the
primitive molecular condensate intact. Unfortunately, the
molecular analog of such atomic condensate does not exist.
Moreover, it has always been a critical challenge to unravel
the true picture when rapid condensation is triggered at the
singularity, since the population rapidly reaches to an astronomically large number. Fractal condensation advances the
conventional theoretical tools for energy quanta condensation
in predicting and analyzing the condensation of molecules
with unique multiple electromagnetic resonance frequencies.
Each resonance frequency acts as a point driving to singularity; resonant oscillation canalizes energy into all singularityattractors or participating resonance frequencies such that
by regulating the resonance levels by modulating the atomic
arrangement of a molecule one could manipulate singularitycanalization and thus program entire supramolecular architecture in an unprecedented manner.

Step 1: Mutual evolution of multiple singularity cones:
Tuning of supramolecular architecture: Time crystal input
to a heat bath containing molecular precursors sends resonance
signal with different frequencies (Figure 9.7b). For molecular
oscillators, the probability of spontaneous synchronization
is maximum when the available energy (kT) is the same as
their total rotational and vibrational energy. When in a heat
bath the molecules are pumped with ac electromagnetic frequencies, the singularity points where coherent resonance
frequency bursts (Sahu et al., 2014; Moskalenko et al., 1980)
attract the system toward them (Figure 9.7c and d). For tubulin to microtubule transition, eight cones in the potential distribution, or eight holes in the phase space (Figures 8.6b and
8.9i, j) changes the relative shapes and preference via modified interaction. The relative population at multiple singularity points determine how do the four levels exchange energy
among themselves leading to the formation of the aggregatewave (Figure 9.7e and f). The normal mode of vibration is preferred over the complete synchronization, non-linear energy
pulling by multiple singularity points causes this preference.
Step 2: Conversion of noise into coherent energy source:
Normal modes of vibrations: Now, non-linear frequency
pulling between different singularity cones determine, what
would happen, the “normal modes of vibration” (Moritsugu
et al., 2010) or “aggregate vibrating as a single wave.”

Brain Jelly to Humanoid Avatar—Fractal Reaction Kinetics, Fractal Condensation, and Programmable Matter

For molecular oscillators, the probability of spontaneous synchronization is maximum when the available energy (kT) is
the same as their total rotational and vibrational energy. When
in a heat bath the molecules are pumped with ac electromagnetic signals, Szent-Györgyi discussed two different mechanisms for the energy transfer, an individual resonant transfer
and a collective transfer, wherein the energy is delocalized, an
aggregate of molecules receives a quantum of energy, via both
parallel channels. Eventually collective transfer supersedes as
a natural drive to decrease the magnitude of energy transfer,
and the system behaves more like a wave than isolated particles. The proposal “aggregate behave like a wave” demands
considering a super molecule, or aggregate that behaves like
a single molecular system (Figure 9.7c and d). A little energy
leak ε is key to generate the wave nature in the distribution of
molecules. The structural damping parameter b regulates leak
between two resonance peaks or two singularity points. Then,
if pumped with an incoherent signal, all oscillators vibrate at
one of the four/more resonance frequencies; the collective
energy exchange activates the non-inversion lasing. Obviously,
the coupling factor between multiple resonance levels refers
to the coupling between the distinct structural symmetries
when electric-magnetic-mechanical resonance activates the
molecules. A molecule if suitably designed such that it’s various structural parts with distinct structural symmetry could
absorb mechanical or electromagnetic energy exposed to it at
different frequencies and each region start vibrating mechanically with a distinct frequency. In doing so, these parts release
energy and interact with energetically coupled neighbors.
During synchronization, the vibrational motion of the system could be such that instead of all neighboring molecules
start vibrating in a single phase and frequency, all molecules
acquire phase and amplitude such that they together map a
virtual 2D wave oscillating in the media. It is called normal
modes of vibration and the most interesting aspect of the creation of this wave is the development of a collective spatial
relationship between all molecules in the medium.
Step 3: Positive feedback during phase transition:
Here we have included Luzzi et al. proposed “positive
feedback” (Mesquita et al., 1993, 1998), surprisingly, this
concept was embedded in the mathematical formulation
of synchronization from discrete randomness. However,
here, the “feedback” occurs when the system has already
formed an aggregate or wave, and therefore “feedback” contains information on how to transform the frequency and
the wavelength of the aggregate-wave so that it undergoes
a “positive” phase transition. The simple yet powerful technique drastically reduces the number of steps required to
lock the phase and the amplitude in a system of large number of coupled oscillators in a series of sequential steps that
would lead to the formation of condensate or cause the disappearance of normal modes of vibration or generate the
true synchrony where all particles have the same phase and
frequency. Note that the formation of condensate means
actually reaching three targets at a time. In summary, the
phase coherent communication via four levels ensures a
well-defined or programmed series of steps to synchrony.

269

However, depending on the complex set of transformations
to be performed for growing the collapsed structure, the
speedup factor would vary.
Step 4: Squeezing of normal modes of vibrations by
four coherent signals: A system self-triggers spontaneously
toward synchrony, when at least four distinct energy levels
operate actively during energy exchange. Two additional
metastable states with two basic levels stabilize population
inversion control remarkably; the “super molecule” concept
derived above since a control engine is must whenever we
construct a fused molecular system or condensate. In order to
construct a super molecule, first, creation of a synchronized
system in a randomly mobile discrete system of oscillators at
far from equilibrium. When that fully synchronized system
oscillates as a single wave, then its four among several energy
levels engage in energy exchange such that by triggering the
system with different frequencies we can change the collision
cross-section, thus, regulate the aggregate-wave’s structural
transitions. Synchronization that triggers the normal modes
of vibration (which is itself a wave made of isolated molecular oscillators) has one vibrational frequency; this has nothing to do with the four frequencies we talk about, these two
concepts should not be mixed, the four frequencies originate
from the internal structural symmetries, due to isolated distinct dynamics of those local parts. In contrast, the normal
modes vibrational frequency originates from the coupling
induced relative energy exchange of the molecule, which
eventually defines the frequency of the system of particles as a
whole. Both parameters are distinct by their origin and nature
of interaction, thus, the four internal frequencies remain constant and cannot be destroyed even after the condensate is
formed, while the normal modes of vibration will change its
wavelength and frequency with a series of quantized changes
to eventually cease as soon as the condensate is formed.
Step 5: Fractal reaction kinetics: Thus, entire self-assembly process occurs via two chemical processes, in the first
half, a transition from collision based normal diffusive motion
of molecules to coordinated motion or spontaneous creation
of normal modes of vibration, which could be explained by
basic laws of chemical kinetics (see schematic of Figure 9.8a)
(Kopelman 1988). However, afterward, during the phase transition of normal modes of vibration to the entropy reduction,
none of the basic considerations of chemical kinetics is valid
in the sequence of steps adopted by the system leading to the
complete collapse. Therefore, this part has always been a mystery in the field of science, and no research was done to visualize this particular process, the point of condensation to the
supramolecular architecture is the “singularity.”
Step 6: Collapse of aggregate waves into a composite
architecture: The 2D aggregate wave oscillates exhibiting
normal modes of vibration. The 2D carpet like an assembly of
molecular oscillators in an aggregate wave would transform
into other structures, via folding, rolling or by other means,
which does not destroy the “integrated wave” features. How
carriers would behave inside a cylinder, cone or sphere if the
2D carpet forms such a hollow structure, the transmission of
carriers on the cylindrical, conical, or spherical surface would

be strictly governed by the surface molecular arrangement and
that would be significantly different from the carriers inside.
The transition should avoid particular local energy minima,
but activate all minima at a time. When delicate topological paths are the only choice for carriers, the edge states in
the fractured band would be regulated by a cavity where the
aggregate wave resides. Recent experiments have shown that
the topological confinement could lead to the formation of
polariton condensation at room temperature, thus, topological
symmetries could coexist and govern multi-channel condensation. The engagement protocol is of two types, first, the new
kind of molecule could interact with any part of the structure
getting physically trapped, thus, add a new resonance level to
the eventual condensate. Second, during phase transition of

“2D aggregate-wave,” the new kinds of molecules could find
a place inside the capsule-space created during folding of the
2D surface, thus, a multi-composite structure is formed in the
organic jelly. By studying a large number of protein crystals
Bandyopadhyay et al. have devised a generic protocol for the
proteins, as described in Chapter 6. For a distinct time crystal
input, the route from aggregate-wave to condensate would be
distinct.
How fractal condensation differs from the world of
Fröhlich condensates: Though Fröhlich (Fröhlich, 1968a,
1968b) and their followers never talked about condensing
molecules but for condensing the propagating carriers on
the biomaterial substrate, they considered resonant oscillations of the dipolar hosts, mostly, they used atomic dipoles

Brain Jelly to Humanoid Avatar—Fractal Reaction Kinetics, Fractal Condensation, and Programmable Matter

for photons or phonon like bosons to reside on those hosts.
Thus, microwave (GHz or THz) ac pumping would synchronize dipoles, which in turn would condense the guest carriers
distributed over the hosts. In this condensation process, an
external ac pumping resonantly excite the oscillators, engage
them into the delocalized collective energy transfer with all
neighbors so that wide range of frequencies (ω0 ≤ ωi ≤ ωN )
and phases in an assembly of n coupled oscillators squeeze
and lock into two particular values. Then, synchronized
oscillators behave together more like a wave than isolated
particles, afterward, one-step toward minimizing entropy
leads to a collapse.
Difference between Haken Prigogine collapse and
fractal condensation: (1) For the formation of a supramolecular complex via far-from-equilibrium Haken-Prigogine
(HP) collapse is a well-debated perspective (Haken, 1988).
Though, synthesis of brain jelly is a thermodynamically open
system operating at far from equilibrium, the aggregate-wave
is formed by long-range interactions and it breaks symmetry spontaneously multiple times prior to the complete collapse into a condensate, the geometry of time is never taken
into account in an HP collapse. In fractal condensation, once
the aggregate wave is formed, afterward, the entire pathway is executed in a programmed manner as a series of dissipative structures are to be formed via ordered transitions.
PPM delivers a sequence of symmetries, chaos or randomness arise due to the projection from infinity as described
in Chapter 4. Even though the manipulation of multiple
singularity points is a route toward complex architectural
engineering of a large number of condensate families arising out of a single condensate. Thus, we look beyond the
world of Prigogine’s random dissipative structures like cloud,
cyclones, and hurricanes to the concept where condensates
inside a condensate inside a condensate forms at a time. (2)
Unlike Fröhlich condensation’s complete synchronization,
and the existence of one resonance frequency was considered
sufficient to generate the condensate, but here for brain jelly
it is not. Without multiple singularity drive, one cannot reach
to the aggregate wave avoiding the straightforward complete
synchronized state. For GML most complex structure is a
icosahedron, a 12 singularity point drive would be abundant
in brain jelly while processing a time crystal. Since previously, the inspirational philosophy was that of Illya Prigogine
(Kondepudi et al., 2017), where complete synchronized state
could randomly jump into an ordered architecture, however,
we follow a philosophy just opposite to that, entire formation
is programmed at the molecules atomic arrangement, hence,
unless and until we create an aggregate wave avoiding full
synchrony, we cannot start programmed adventure toward a
predicted architecture.

9.5.1

Pattern of Primes Need Not to Be Instructed

As explained in Chapter 7 in details, 17 brain components
discussed above have a large number of components within.
Following the actual brain architecture, those tiny components are built using organic synthesis; however, there is a big

271

problem. How several components and their sub-components
build together following fractal condensation and fractal reaction kinetics?
Jordon structure and bifurcation: Adjacency matrix:
what computation means for brain jelly? Bifurcation is
symmetry breaking. During synchronization and desynchronization of local time crystals, associative matrix D is
“adjacency matrix,” it has been shown mathematically that
bifurcation does not depend on how many networks are
there, rather it depends on a number of Jordon structure. Two
neighboring brain components share D, and that one could
study separately in a chemical beaker The Jordon structure is
strictly related to the time crystal built by geometric algebra
(Chapter 4) since, the dimension of Jordon structure holds
fundamentals of coupling. In a network of interactive time
crystals (set of {f(t)}), center subspace in regular networks is
given by dF = α I + β A, here, α I determines internal dynamics of a time crystal, α is the matrix of internal dynamics, β A
is the coupling dynamics between two nests. A is the adjacent matrix, whose eigenvalues account for the coupling of
subsets of N network, it determines magnitudes of all possible coupling factors, β is the matrix of coupling dynamics.
Jordon structure J associated with a 0 eigenvalue can be the
Jordon structure of an adjacency matrix of a regular network.
The above mathematical expression describing symmetrybreaking bifurcation solution of a problem means a product of (Golubitsky and Lauterbach, 2009) adjacent matrices
representing a time fractal f(t) to find a new matrix in the
timeline.

9.6 FRACTAL REACTION KINETICS—PARALLEL
SYNTHESES IN ONE BEAKER AT A TIME
Fractal reaction kinetics and memory in the chemical reaction: Biological reproduction has mastered selfreplication (Smith et al., 2003). It has inspired bio-mimetic
engineering, nano-assemblers, designing computer virus as
artificial life (Spafford, 1992; Chow et al., 2004; Lipson and
Pollack, 2000), and distributive computing, etc. There exists
no generic rule for self-replication, fractal reaction kinetics (Kopelman, 1988; Khire et al., 2010; Vlad et al., 2005;
Neff et al., 2011; Newhouse and Kopelman, 1988; Savageau,
1998) that memorizes the reaction rates and responds to the
ever-changing environment spontaneously could be used as
a generic synthetic protocol for self-replication (Figure 9.8a).
However, in the last three decades only one kind of “memorization” was explored whereas for programming self-replication of several different visible scale architectures (Tong
et al., 2011; Kurihara et al., 2011) in the atomic arrangement
of the molecules or any starting materials we have to invent
several different kinds of “memorization” process (Kozlov
et al., 2013; Varela et al., 1974; Bedau et al., 1997) when a
fractal reaction evolves the product with time. Ghosh et al.
started with a 7 nm wide molecular platform (Ghosh et al.,
2014b; Figure 9.8b), modified it with a few functional groups
to trigger robustly varying “memorization” of reaction rates.

272

The memory regulation has led to an encyclopedia of geometric replication (Figure 9.8c and d). The encyclopedia includes
right-triangle tessellation (Figure 9.8e), alternative spherical
and spiral geometries (Figure 9.8f) similar to fourth-circuit
element Hinductor, H that could be switched using pH variation (Zhang et al., 2010) like that we see in DNA, galaxies, spherical fractal like Russian nesting doll Matryoshka
(Agnati et al., 2009) and ever-growing branching like a tree.
Three decades ago, memory in a reaction allowed the system to direct reaction in the most suitable route in a changing environment, now by adding a higher-level control to that
memory we enable the system to program that path. In the
solution 109 orders larger architectures grow spontaneously
with zero human intervention, yet, the system switches nonlinearly among various paths to reproduce.
Could there be a chemical reaction that starts from a few
atoms and grow entire architecture? Now, Ghosh et al. have
experimentally demonstrated (Ghosh et al., 2016a) that we can
add a higher-level control on that memory, to drive memorization through various ways. It means a system (brain jelly) can
hold at a time, multiple different kinds of memories as time
crystals and switch between different routes as programmed or
the changing environment demands. We cannot add complexity
if we have just one memory as a single clock. With the power
to flip between multiple memories, we create multiple fractals
for dual or multi-faced self-replication in a single chemical beaker, with zero human intervention. Unlike classical chemical
kinetics that defines chemistry, the hallmark of “fractal-like”
kinetics explores anomalous reaction orders and time dependent reaction rate, which are otherwise “constant” over time.
The area beyond the fundamental laws of chemical kinetics and
laws of mass action is part of heterogeneous reaction kinetics
observed in biology, materials science, geology, astrophysics,
etc. In fractal-like kinetics, due to spatial constraint, it can dramatically speed up or slow down the reaction rate, hence for
half a century it has been proposed as a fundamental structural
tool. However, this field has mostly been about the theoretical
interpretation of the frequently observed biological or chemical
phenomenon. Thus, the fundamental concept of “fractal-like”
kinetics has not progressed beyond the basic definitions, which
Ghosh et al. transformed forever.
What makes fractal reaction kinetics so unique? The journey beyond classical kinetics to “fractal kinetics” involves some
remarkable features like self-ordering, self-unmixing of reactants, rate coefficients with temporal memories, etc. All these
parameters are thoroughly investigated as a part of heterogeneous reaction kinetics. If we compare these typical parameters
with the tasks of PPM-driven natural intelligence, we can draw
an analogy between the two. Fractal reaction kinetics monitors
reactants and products by memorizing its own reaction rates and
decides its next reaction rate; this is what a spontaneously operating artificial brain should do in a hostile environment. The literature of self-replication has argued for similar qualities for a
long time; however, fractal reaction kinetics was never examined thoroughly from self-replication perspective.

Nanobrain

The basic idea behind the hierarchical memory in reaction kinetics: In order to be useful in self-replication, fractal reaction kinetics should not only demonstrate a typical
linear temporal variation over log(time) scale suggested by
Kopelman (1988) as we have seen in almost all reported works
in the last three decades. The lone memorization capability
requires a hierarchical control on memory to add complexity
in the massive architectures as the self-replication demands.
Hence, Ghosh et al. added control on the basic memorization
protocol of fractal reaction rate and identified major limiting possibilities of temporal variations of a fractal reaction
rate. Temporal variation of reaction rate over log(time) scale
which has always been linear. In the same plot Ghosh et al.
introduced an exponential decay, an exponential increase, and
a periodic switching between two parallel linear variations.
Minor modifications in the starting dendritic structure lead to
various fractal synthesis routes and unique geometric shapes
are repeated from a few nm to cm scales, we can observe how
higher-level control on memory is played.
For an exponential increment and decrement, the rate of
variation of k also varies with time (logk = exp ± S(logt) + M,
S, M ~ constants, h = f(logt)). Second-order variation of memory suggests that higher-order control of h on k. Here, even h
is a function of time. In the switching between spherical and
helical fractal, one hierarchical memory control h (=f(logt))
regulates the exponential variation of k and a nearly linear
k embeds a hierarchical control h to return. Similarly, the
nearly periodic oscillation between the two rates for trianglesquare fractal suggests a quadratic control in the singular
fractal system to memorize two fundamentally distinct architectural growths in a single chemical beaker. Self-replication
is a prerogative of nature as it can modulate the fractal rate.
Higher level memory in regulating the chemical kinetics is a
generic protocol to merge the gap between the existing automated intelligence and the biological intelligence exhibited by
nature in reproduction.

NANOBRAIN, THE SMALLEST LIFE FORM

Nanobrain, NB, or PCMS (Pamam dendrimer, controller,
molecular motor and sensor) has all the three components of
a life form. It can sense, it can work, and most importantly it
can process decisions. Figure 9.9a shows what happens at the
core of this smallest life form. Different multi-level switches
or H, H1, and H3 devices incorporated inside acquire the time
crystals via sensors connected outside. Then they start vibrating following the symmetries of frequencies prescribed in the
PPM. During this quasi vibration charges of various natures
produce, they follow their own symmetries in the PPM
(Figure 9.9b). Eventually, they build distribution of phase
(Figure 9.9c). By now readers know that such a distribution
of geometric phase with an intricate 3D geometry is called a
time crystal which would pinpoint the unique PPM and the
course of future dynamics of the whole system. That regulatory phase distribution of polarons or any quasi particles

containing the conditions to encode singularity points in
a clock actually writes its quasi charge distribution on the
surface of the systems phase sphere and that could be read
as a time crystal using monochromatic laser (Figure 9.9d).
The projected architecture of artificial atoms (assembly of
vortices) containing a solution to the problem is shown in
Figure 9.9e.
Each multipolar resonance can be locally driven at points
where the coupling between the quantum emitter and antenna
connected to the life form is efficient. The electric mode density is high at the ends of a nanowire regardless of the symmetry of the resonant mode. Therefore, a point source (electric
dipole) at the end of a Hinductor, H nanowire couple to all
possible resonant modes, breaking the symmetry that might
prevent access by far-field illumination, and encompassing
both sub- and super-radiant modes irrespective of symmetry.

H devices self-assemble as nano-antenna (Taminiau et al.,
2011) and might operate in the entire optical frequency range
and beyond (Della Valle et al., 2008). H antennas are ultrasensitive to polarization and dark modes at various selective
regions (Kajetan Schmidt et al., 2012). Quantum antennas
forming a fourth-circuit element could deliver quantum information processing (Curto et al., 2013) via PPM. The complete
process, how sensor, processor, and motor work, is shown
schematically in Figure 9.9f.

9.7.1 Jelly of Megamers Following
a Resonance Chain
In the artificial nano brain, the organic jelly captures the solution of a problem via triggering synchrony of a particular pattern of time crystals with its nearest match with the 15 shapes of

274

GML. By successive learning, the brain jelly stores high-level
time crystals as associated rules, which are called through synchrony as soon as external environmental conditions demand.
For that reason, computing time is not the sum of the times
taken by individual matching processes; rather, time taken for
the resonance between two individual neurons determines the
global speed of computation. The time taken for two neurons
to resonantly vibrate is more than four neurons to vibrate resonantly. However, in contrast, under noise, more is the number
of coupled neurons in an environment, faster is the time to find
a perfect match. Works of literature are rich in mathematically
arguing that synchronization speeds up when the environment
is more chaotic. We can understand the underlying complex
mathematical treatments with a simple time crystal: more is
the randomness in a system, higher is the probability that the
matching condition already exists as a pre-set situation even
before the synchronization begins. Therefore, as soon as the
synchronization is triggered, the already existing pre-set condition supersedes other options and that would reduce the
convergence time drastically. It is mathematically shown that
topological randomness decreases the synchronization time
by several orders (Grabow et al., 2010).
During this period there is no transmission of a signal
between the components, because it’s a supramolecular architecture one inside another. One such example is megamer
shown in Figure 9.10a–e. The whole architecture is simply
extrapolation of the smallest life form described above, however, there are differences (Figure 9.10f). The journey of computing is summarized in Figure 9.10g. Earlier, there used to
be a linear circuit, then using 16 molecules Bandyopadhyay
and Acharya (2008) showed that information processing turns
rapid, now 3D system shows one could carry out complex processing without any outside communication. The synthesis of
brain jelly superstructure advances the wheel model of the
brain. Using a very simple scheme we have reminded reader
how the primitive idea of clock inside a clock that started at the
beginning of this book ends here (Figure 9.10h). Each component is a PPM and their resonance bands have common resonance frequency points which enable smooth energy transfer
between the components (Figure 9.10i). Such overlaps when
plotted for the entire brain jelly architecture, one derives the
resonance chain once again, earlier it was for the real brain
components, now it is for the brain jelly (Figure 9.10j). Now,
we would dig deeper into the fundamentals of the resonance
chain.
Multilayered synchrony: non-linear frequency pulling in the entire Fractal tape network: harmonic and
anharmonic oscillation The artificial brain described here
is made of brain jelly, an evolving organic architecture that
senses the rhythms and elementary seed that takes part in
the process is the nano brain. Now, we can either consider
brain jelly as a material or just a network of rhythm, simply a time crystal. At every stage of the proposed artificial
brain, starting from the input of signals from the external

Nanobrain

environment to the main processing unit, the core brain,
signals are synchronized, time crystals are linked. At every
stage, coupling and de-­coupling of time crystal take place
to favor synchrony or desynchrony. Since entire brain jelly
network is made of high-quality factor oscillators (quality
factor ~ number of oscillations before the energy decreases
by 1/2π times the initial energy), non-linear frequency pulling plays a vital role in generating synchrony. The general
expression for harmonic oscillation is given by, 0 = 
xn + xn,
then we add linear damping γ xn, then we can add reactive
coupling, ∑ m Dmn ( xm − xn ), also add further non-linear stiffening xn3, and or energy input −γ Dxn (1 − xn2 ), and then add
the signal 2 gDcos [(1 + δω D )t ]. An oscillator driving near
resonance ωD ≅ 1, it means that the driving frequency turns
identity, it is not required. A single-driven damped anharmonic oscillator follows 
x + γ x + x + x 3 = 2 g D cos(ω Dt ).
Anharmonic and harmonic behavior coexists in a time crystal network that drives the nano brain and the brain jelly.
Non-linear frequency pulling means if the system if pumped
at other frequencies, the system automatically drives it to ω D,
the natural driving frequency.
Spontaneous generation of higher level rhythms:
re-defining intelligence and creativity: For every typical
input time crystals or rhythms, from external environment,
the neural network in the artificial brain naturally construct
an output set of time crystals or rhythms. If the network uses
this input-output set repeatedly; it is stored as a favored rule
for that particular transformation. We call it a higher-level
rule, since the neural network would always try to impose it,
naturally, if any structurally similar time crystal-cluster is
created in the upper brain. When we construct a typical artificial brain, we need to decide beforehand what would be the
minimum size of a time crystal and the maximum size that
is process-able for the given brain architecture. In another
word the material seed or nano brain decides how the brain
jelly would form, smallest sized time crystals would be processed using highest frequencies and the largest size time
crystals would use the lowest operational frequencies. Both
the lower and the upper limits are determined by the kind of
basic oscillators or neurons we use to write the basic time
crystals. The resonance frequency is a basic hardware property of an oscillator, and there are several different kinds
of oscillators; depending on their operation, resonance frequencies are strictly defined. For the composite time crystals, it would be like a composite electromagnetic oscillator,
whose resonance frequencies would also be a strictly defined
parameter.
Resonance in damped anharmonic oscillator: For
learning the time crystals break links following equationgiven by 
x + γ x + x + x 3 = 2 g D cos ωDt , damping factor is γ ,
drive strength is g D , the drive frequency is ωD, for resonance
ωD ≈ 1. Smaller g D means a lower non-linearity, which means,
ωD = 1 + εΩ D , g D = ε 3/ 2 g and γ = εΓ, when we consider
ε << 1, g , Γ, Ω D are unity.

High Q oscillators follow the equation below: Equation of
clocking path on the phase sphere of a time crystal undergoes
diameter displacement x during sensing an input geometry for
activation of GML is 0 = 
xn + xn, we add linear damping term,
γ 
xn; we take δ n from g (δ n ) and add its function δ n xn; then we add
reactive coupling term ∑ m Dnm ( xm − xn ); non-linear stiffening
term xn3; energy input γ D xn (1 − xn2 ); signal 2 g D cos [(1 + δωD )t ]
and then there could be additional noise term.
An accurate description of synchronization with
simultaneity is impossible: The coupling between two time
crystals, is the coupling between multiple basic Hinductor,

H oscillators via wireless energy transfer in the beginning. If that wireless energy exchange mode is practiced
more, slowly a physical bonding grows between the oscillators, since more and more common clocks get engage in
the energy exchange process. The nature of physical bonding defines the foundation of mathematical formulation for
mutual synchronization until the construction of physical
wiring is completed. The fundamental problem of addressing mutual synchronization is that amplitude and phase vary
simultaneously, and almost all theories find some reasons to
avoid one and go ahead with the other. One such example:

276

“oscillators are strongly attracted to their limit cycle, so
amplitude variation could be neglected and phase variation needs to be considered.” Now, there could be several
different kinds of glues-for-coupling, dipole-dipole interaction, H bonding, etc., which are weak bonding in the energy
range of 1–10 kCal, but not the strong covalent bonding
(~400 kCal). For weak bonding, mathematical formulations
ignore subtle fluctuations for simplicity, and as we have
argued in Chapter 2, many-body interaction formulations
for phase locked synchronization (Strogatz and Mirollo,
1988) do not fit for the “simultaneity adventure” exercised
here. At this point, we note that weak bonding only brings
basic oscillator neurons (Hinductor class 2 or H2 devices) at
least in a favorable orientation; similar to real brain’s neural
network, stronger, practice-based consolidation of coupling
protocol is established, but the neurons cannot create new
axon channels if necessary. To compensate, for the artificial brain made of organic jelly, we use molecular machines,
which have inherent dynamics to get coupled with the other
machines physically at a particular electric field eventually forming giant nano-wires via self-assembly. There are
various kinds of locks, one that helps in morphing is called
injection locking.
Injection locking: When the coupling is strong enough
and the frequencies near enough, the second oscillator can
capture the first oscillator, causing it to have essentially identical frequency as the second. It is injection locking. When the
second oscillator merely disturbs the first but does not capture
it, the effect is called injection pulling.
All components in the resonance chain, reply back
via non-radiative energy transfer. The technology relies
on the “electromagnetic transparency” of the material,
as described in Section 8.9, as cloaking. However, due to
large reflection coefficient the transparency develops opacity, i.e., anomalous quantum cloaking. Thus, the screening
effect restricts wireless communication beyond certain
limits of the immediate neighborhood. As described earlier, three hallmarks of the artificial brain, (i) electrical,
magnetic, and electromagnetic resonance, (iii) cloaking,
(iii) holographic projection, following e − π − φ quadratic
relation. For this reason, we cannot rely on an antennareceiver concept to scale up the “reply back” technology,
where radiation energy passes through the air between two
materials, the philosophy requires a fundamental change.
Alternatively, we have introduced a multi-layered structure
where output structural product of one waveform connects
12 layers nested within and above.
For each layer, the resonance band has three distinct
domains, one domain is used to communicate with the inner
layer, and one with the external layer, one layer is kept for
its own information processing. Thus, all layers are energetically connected by a single chain of resonance band,
irrespective of the size of the device architecture now a wireless communication can transmit without getting screened

Nanobrain

anywhere. The energy given as an input at any layer transmits
to the entire chain of resonance bands, both ways, toward the
lower and toward the higher frequency regions of the chain.
Any form of energy is suitably absorbed and then transmitted
across the resonance chain. A resonance chain connects every
single computing seed in the system; thus, zillions of seeds
are wired into a massively complex yet a single network in the
form of a time crystal.

9.7.2 EEG of a Nanobrain
At the very beginning of the interaction with a natural event
happening around us, the frontal lobe of our brain controls
the five major sensory organs to collect maximum information from the external world, and immediately the captured
information is converted into a stream of pulses. In the brain
jelly there is no pulse stream. A time crystal is an endless
network of rhythms (infinite series mathematically), it
projects a set of optical and or magnetic vortices, which
is finite, defined as an argument when it includes a time
function, means after a certain time, it would change to
another time crystal, in this book we use time crystal in
general, often it means an equivalence of argument. In this
path, a checkerboard of pulses that keeps timing (gridding)
remains constant throughout. The multilayered wave-stream
that is formed in the sensors is simply a superposition of
several 2D patterns. Composition of wireless (parallel) and
wired (serial) circuiting is delicately balanced to make sure
that time-grids prepared by different sensory-organs match
with each other so that eventually we get a unified time-grid
for synthesizing combined time crystal for visual, auditory,
touch, taste and smell wave-streams. Once all time crystals
produced in different sensory-organs are locked by the unified time-grid, there are several points where informationprocessing language could be verified. The objective here
is to understand nature using the true language of the brain,
GML, this will not be the ultimate one, but it will mark the
beginning of understanding the brain in the way it is, and subsequent rectifications in the following years would deliver the
final grammar to read the signal absolutely captured from any
part of the brain.
One way to confirm that time crystal language, GML is to
read the brain jelly’s EEG. Figure 9.11a shows as brain-like
prototype device filled with organic jelly and several neural
network-like cables are connected to input time crystals as a
stream of electrical pulses. Figure 9.11b shows fully operational module for such a device, where using a high-resolution
camera, the evolution of jelly is observed as a function of time
(Figure 9.11c). By shining laser and reading the magnetic vortices one could read the time crystals instantly. One nice way
to advance the simple module of Figure 9.11b is to build an
ensemble of several such devices and arrange them in a fractal
structure. Only the geometric feature alone could trigger EEG
similar to a human brain (Figure 9.11c).

time crystal is shown schematically. At the very bottom we demonstrate the EEG pattern with the brain jelly.

9.8 TUNING UNDEFINED HOLES
TO SENSE MAGNETIC LIGHT
We summarize again, how the brain jelly works, now using
simple mathematical numbers. Figure 9.12a shows that by
changing the geometric parameters of an H device one
could switch on or off desired number of singularity points
or holes in the phase space. Also, even without understanding much detailed mathematics, one could draw equivalent time crystals, crudely. Say, three such helices come
together, representing 3, 6, and 12 (Figure 9.12b). Now, if
one wants to draw the phase space of the assembly, it would
find three singularities for the simplest scenario, one for
each H devices. Most importantly, in the holes or singularities the phase space corresponding to the 6, 5, and 12 would
reside. It means they would affect by phase alone. Now,
all four components, 5, 6, 12, and 3 have their own time
crystals, where the time crystal of 3 is the host, others are
guests. When laser light falls on this cluster, this very phase
space is projected as a composition of magnetic vortices as
shown to the right of the Figure 9.12b. We can draw circles
on this magnetic image and could read solution, what is the
final outcome.

Exponential speedup without using entanglement:
One important aspect of a such a brain-jelly-based computing at the molecular scale is that these mixed states which
are responsible for the logical reduction, but in these states
during measurement, when exactly the computation occurs,
we need to stop entanglement still allowing superposition
to continue. It is the measure of discord, namely quantum
discord in a system. In the case of the classical logic gate
there is no superposition, hence the possibility of simultaneous reduction operation does not arise, which is very
much possible in a quantum computer. One very important
question that we ask here is the need for the pure entangled
states, would it be possible to construct a decision-making
PPM without pure states? Jozsa and Linden (2003) have
argued that an exponential computational speedup might be
possible with mixed states in the total absence of entanglement, and entanglement is essential only if computing is performed with the pure states only. Magnetic vortices based
time crystal is fit to exponential speedup (Lloyd, 1999) irrespective of spatial scale, since here in the entire book we
replace every single physical parameter in the universe using
time crystals (see Chapter 4), if some parameters left, would
be done soon.

FIGURE 9.12 (a) In quantum, we have only one phase space with two classical points, but for us there are no classical points but 1–12
variable number of holes or singularities in the phase space. We can open or close n number of holes to write any integer. The chart shows
different number of holes in the phase space of the H device. Below a schematic is presented to explain the length, pitch diameter and lattice
parameters acquired by the H device to generate the holes and finally below the equivalent time crystal to be produced. (b) A single chart
begins with the self-assembly of three H devices representing integers, 5, 6, and 12. In the next step we show how inside the singularity of
three holes the phase spheres of three components enter. S21 reading of transmission spectrum delivers the result. Then in the third step
we explained how the time crystals look like for three elements and how they self-assemble into an architecture of combined time crystal.
In the fourth step we see the final magnetic vortices images. These images are fed to simulator to build time crystal. Holes in phase space
act like bonds. Holes blink periodically, hence phase spaces are like orbitals of molecules with vectors, the 3D distribution of vectors try to
minimize, i.e., sum of vectors = 0, in doing so, supramolecular architectures are born.

If superposition of magnetic vortex atoms mix the vibrating
states via synchronization of oscillators, then it is possible
to generate an exponential speed. If we can demonstrate that
mixed state computing could be implemented to speed up
those intractable problems exponentially which are essentially required to resolve the brain-like computing then we
can demonstrate that synchronization is superior to entanglement in solving the problems that brains required to solve.
However, for “search and find” problems even in the classical “nested synchrony” it is a 3D network of co-existing
synchronized and desynchronized states. It means in simple
words, without using extensive mathematics the pattern
of primes PPM can suggest that for the mixed state also,
non-entangled processing has to continue along with the
entangled processing, and then it has to wait for the other
processes to be complete. In the “nested synchrony” protocol, which is the hallmark of fractal mechanics proposed in
Chapter 4, the entire hardware is coupled and time wasted
is minimum, in principle there is no time delay in a time
crystal scenario. Even before a clock senses the information reaches several layers below, determines the modified
rhythms as solutions and sends to the higher-level slower

scales. Thus, the solution always reaches “instantaneously”
just like quantum entanglement, though it is a purely classical scenario.

9.8.1 Spiral Nanowire Writes Time Crystal—
Sense It as a Crystal of Light
Brain jelly’s adoptability of accepting new hardware components: The truth table of 15 primes: The most fundamental truth-table for any brain-jelly-based decision-making
non-computer is shown in Figure 9.13. If one builds an operational brain jelly, he has to present such a table. For every 15
prime, a related symmetry there should be a material structure and a distinct signature of magnetic and optical vortices.
We did not fill up the table to suggest one needs only a few
primes to simulate 90% of events happening around nature.
The brain jelly should be able to accommodate new kind of
oscillators or structure embedded into it using these elementary prime structures so that it could enhance the power of
computation, evolve under fatal conditions. If we observe the
human brain architecture, depending on the processing necessity, it has developed several different kinds of neurons, and

other components, all these components, demonstrate oscillator like behavior. PPM-inspired artificial brain explored here
will not have the capability of constructing new kinds of oscillators; however, if we find the necessity from outside and supply, then it should be able to accommodate it internally. Two
objects are considered to be equivalent, or “homeomorphic,”
if one can be morphed into the other by simply twisting and
stretching its surface; they are different if we have to cut or
crease the surface of one to reshape it into the form of the
other. All Hinductor or H devices that are the key ingredient for brain jelly are homeomorphic to accommodate smaller
changes, but for larger, they add or decrease length to morph
an external input.
The supremacy of brain’s pattern recognition: Brain
jelly processes information by capturing images using an
effective visual technology—blinds make those images using
sounds—blind, deaf, and dumb make those images in the
brain by touching the objects. However, irrespective of the
origin of those images, the brain follows a unified geometric language GML protocol to analyze and prepare them for
learning. We look at a picture but do not see every part of
it distinctly, only a few geometrical points are noted, converted into primes just as outlined in the table, the color band
and contrast regions are noted but no specific details are
pointed out at the first instance, we zoom at a very specific

region, see only that part which is very interesting to us. It is a
fantastic way to minimize the amount of information need to
be processed and stored in the brain—suggesting an essential
feature of an artificial brain to zoom an interesting part while
capturing a visual. All geometric structures are produced by
hyperbolic functions so that rhythms or time fractals come
into picture and “nested geometry” is converted into “time
crystals” that could be encoded into the materials property.
It is the foundation of “brain jelly.”

9.8.2

Writing Prime Numbers in a Jelly

How a brain jelly builds a geometric shape and synthesis a PPM: A brain jelly has to process 15 geometric shapes
(Figure 9.13), it means by synthesis it has to produce organic
supramolecular architectures, preferably helices and vortices
as outlined by the fourth-circuit element, H. We already know
by now that H devices are such that they build 12-hole phase
space that blinks when the structure changes its geometry
continuously. However, if the external user sends a particular
ac signal to write a particular geometry, then the structure that
is created does not change the geometry which fixes the number of holes in the 12-hole phase space. The number of holes
is the numbers of the corners a geometric shape has. Thus, a
geometric shape is created. It is very interesting how to select

280

a suitable H device to build a brain jelly, given that thousands
of reports on the synthesis of helices are there. Figure 9.12a
shows one such example, where a typical multi-layered helical nanowire namely microtubule found in the neurons to all
eukaryotic cells are shown. It does not generate all 12 number
of holes when one measures the reflectance and transmittance
of these materials, but only a few, especially 2, 3, and 5, are
enough to synthesis all other primes. Figure 9.12b shows how
actually three nanowires 5, 6, and 12 holes come together.
The 12-hole phase spaces for the three elements 5, 6, and 12
build a new phase space represented as 3. In the singularity
domain of the phase space with three holes, the other three,
5, 6, and 12 enters. In reality, the distribution of static charge
on the helix surface undergoes rapid oscillation and due to
birefringence, polarized electromagnetic signals produced
from the device H generates magnetic vortices which are
time crystals. The projection of magnetic vortex atom assemblies is the driving force for the self-assembly of the other
H devices. However, please note that we have used magnetic
vortex atoms, that does not mean this is the only way to build
brain jelly, one could build ionic vortex-like neurons do in the
axons, or molecular diffusion could create vortex, even sound
or mechanical waves could build vortex of solitons that could
act like virtual atoms. In general, vortex atoms are the coolest tool to write read time crystals, wireless, ultralow power
processing is evident.

9.9 ENTROPY DRIVES THE SYNTHESIS
OF A PATTERN OF PRIMES
However, the synthesis of H with 15 possible geometries is
only the first step. Creation of a single H device with a single
geometric shape is not enough. To build the structure representing the primes, these elementary structures with the elementary geometric shapes are to combine and then build the
composite structure of H devices as outlined in the table of
Figure 9.13. Here is the key. We do not endorse any particular material, but whatever be the material used for building a
brain jelly, should first synthesis H devices in the solution or
gel matrix. Then, it should engage in creating the 15 primes
as necessary. Finally, the primes would self-assemble to create the divisors of the integers sent as an input. Say, we want
to write a triangle with a ratio of 13:43:7, then only the three
prime structures on demand would be produced from the
elementary H devices and these prime structures would come
together. However, if we send a sum of ac frequencies as a
modulated waveform, or otherwise as the materials synthesis
demands to write 24:27:99 then, all the divisors of the integers
would be produced. In the solution, the divisors would follow
the Hasse diagram as outlined in Figure 9.14a. For the spiral
helices, how the composition of divisors might look like in
the solution are outlined in Figure 9.14b. Following the Hasse
diagram, the thermodynamic entropy regulates synthesis so
that coupling the primes build the integers. It is beautiful
mathematics of entropy played by H devices in the solution,
as if thermodynamics conspires to lead the self-assembly

Nanobrain

toward the synthesis of integers from the primes following
PPM. As if nature conspires to follow PPM. When the divisors are born, the journey through the Hasse diagram results
in building the all possible structures that those divisors could
synthesize. There are errors in the production of integers, and
that thermodynamic error takes us through the path of perfecting the 3D pattern of PPM.
Say, in the solution, all the divisors made of primes
2, 3, 7 are produced. That number of divisors is not less.
For example, 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 7, 3 × 3 × 2, 7 × 7 × 7,
etc. Following this route an infinite number of divisors could
be generated; however, the desired divisors and their few
neighbors are created. To understand it simply, if the desired
divisors are 2 × 2 × 3, 3 × 7 and 2 × 7 × 2 × 3 then, in the
solution, 2 × 2 × 3 × 2, 7 × 2 × 2 × 3, 3 × 7 × 2 × 2, etc.
structures would be created naturally as an error. Thus, in the
PPM plot, which is built by connecting the nearest neighbors
in the ordered factors of integers, we get many dots as more
and more erroneous products flood the solution. Connecting
the nearest neighbors is also like minimizing entropy, just
the way discrete isolated atoms or molecules come together
and build a crystal of atoms or molecules. Thus, the PPM
plot is an account of Hasse’s universal protocol, when errors
take over. And then, another beautiful thing happens in the
solution or synthesis matrix. PPMs have several loops, and
the errors trigger those loops which and drives the formation
of erroneous products more to fill the missing points of the
loops. The natural thermodynamic drive wants to close the
loops in the PPMs and that expands the geometric input pattern as shown in Figure 9.14c.

9.9.1

Hasse Diagram for Entropy Builds
Material Analog of Integers

Creation of the column of time crystals by self-assembly
follows a power law: While describing the Hasse diagram
above we have noted that the energy transmission follows a
unique mathematical pathway. The brain jelly starts learning from the first time crystals encoded in the amygdala,
and then more and more time crystals are added. The addition process is very special. When two time crystals are
added to the hardware, new higher-level coupling rules are
created and similarly more and more high-level coupling
rules are born automatically. If we make a simple calculation that only one resonance peak represents a singularity and
only one peak represents a pair of singularity points burst to
emit energy, then for the nth addition of paired time crystal
will find ~n2 + 1 number of higher-level coupling rules are
automatically added. These automatic additions of higherlevel couplings follow fractal relationship and develop their
own phase transition rules during learning. Therefore, during
self-assembly of time crystals by the brain jelly an astronomically large number of phase transition rules are also created
and stored, and that is controlled by boundary conditions set
to the choices and options. Choices are integer and options
are ordered factor (Figure 9.14d). If we simply consider that
a pair of exhibitory and inhibitory time crystals are there,

transmission, synthesis of divisors. Integer = total number of holes in the assembly of helices Hasse diagram, X, Y, and Z directions represent
three primes, 2, 3, 5, since it regulates entropy, we control its boundary by applying magnetic pulses. Computing is simultaneous electric,
magnetic, mechanical resonance. (b) How a set of primes builds integers by synthesis, depends how does a helix manage hole production
in phase space. Some helices produce all 12 holes, some only a few, if s helix produces only four types of holes,—1, 2, 3, 5—then we can
build all integers by synthesis. We can use 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively. (c) Three self-assembly steps, make integer, build
divisors and OF, finally OF assembly and PPM loop assembly. The common line between two loops activates each other. A loop forms a
layer, multiple loops forms, core-shell architecture magnetic field decides the number of loops, mechanical resonance decides search and
find thermodynamically preferred helix, electrical resonance assists in healing wireless wiring between the helices. (d) The nearest neighbor
of an OF point (OF, N) connects as a line, so, a point finds unique neighbors depending on width of N and OF, represented as ∆ . Above, a
series of plots show that the relative width of OF and N, i.e., ∆OF / ∆N determines nearest neighbors. Here ∆N is the number of oscillators
active in the solution, this number is tuned by applying magnetic and mechanical vibrations. Electrical wireless writing, magnetic arresting
of neighbors and mechanical vibrations to activate the search mode operate e 2 + ϕ 2 = π 2.

then n2 + 1 additional coupling increases to n4 + 1 and so on.
When two time crystals generate one new cluster of a time
crystal, three bursts from one loop, then we get a converging
triangle. The synchronization/response time will depend on
the number of different frequency fractals used, not on the
complexity of the path.
Geometric shapes and the brain circuits: Brain jelly
is therefore similar to layered hyperbolic metamaterial
system proposed recently (Poddubny et al., 2013) fit to
process fractal time (Smolyaninov, 2012). The negative
refractive index that defines a metamaterial as an integral
component for brain jelly, since there is no wiring, metamaterial feature enables a particular component to vanish
letting other signals to pass through. Thus, entropy under

invisible components behaves in a non-predictable manner
if we think about energy alone. The picture gets clear when
we read the geometric shape transition. In the forest of H
devices when there is no wiring cloaking and 3D arrangement to hold a particular geometry is the way to build a
living circuit. For an S, U, L, V, T, all 1D patterns convert
into a straight line and those straight lines bond in a circle
simultaneously for the natural oscillation of the network of
the oscillator to create the typical feature of a 1D shape.
For the platonic 2D and 3D geometries, all structures eventually convert to a circle and sphere, i.e., eventually all 15
structures convert into a 3D structure or a vortex atom.
The “most complex” or the “most non-Abelian” subgroup
of SO(3) is the symmetry of the icosahedron—the largest

282

Platonic polyhedron, in some counting, which is the same
as the symmetry of the dual dodecahedron, the origin of
these groups are explained using string theory.
These cross-sections of circle or sphere and the 2D, 3D
geometric shapes get more energy and these frequency values play a dominant role in the further oscillations. As a
result, we find that the ratio of these contact point frequencies
become the variable in the hardware. Since all-encompassing
circles have the same area the ratios play a key role in defining
the major terms of the rhythm. The line, 2D or 3D geometric
shape to circle or sphere-like oscillation conversion requires
certain time, and that depends on the shape of the internal
structure. Based on that the frequencies on the circle and
the straight-line or on the sphere are selected for the rhythm
construction. Therefore, the ratio of frequencies and the time
delay determines all the terms for the time fractal or the
rhythm to be constructed for the geometric shape. The role
of the triplet of triplet resonance band in constructing the
rhythms: Is it essential? Triplet band is essential because this
is the minimum number of bands required to create a resonance chain, if each oscillator does not have three bands then
it cannot handshake with the oscillators holding the clock
below and above, apart from its own information processing,
three bands are must. And nature has taken utmost care to
this requirement.

9.10 THE CORTICAL PEN THAT
FREEZES UNKNOWN DYNAMICS
INTO A TIME CRYSTAL
Humanoid avatar is not the only application of brain jelly,
one could build a tiny pen that would assist a user to solve
big data problem or provide an intelligent solution when we
are totally confused. As said earlier, to use GML, PPM-based
computing we search for confusion. Then find some more
confusions within, take one confusion and dig deeper, the
journey continues until we reach facts. Now, an artificial cortical column-based prototype is shown in Figure 9.15a. The 19
parallel cortical column channels are detailed in Figure 9.15b.
Using 19 Yagi antenna we apply input time crystal, the output
is read by the camera on the left. Seven gel layers are filled in
the capillary tube made cortical columns. In future, it would
be reduced to a commercial pen-like device as shown in
Figure 9.15c, wherein one should put particular cortical column miniaturized like a capsule. The operation of a capsule is
shown in Figure 9.15d, where during computation how a particular architecture grows and saturates at different layers is
shown. Side by side we have shown the PPM how the column
represents part of it. How to read output of a magnetic film is
shown below Figure 9.15b, lines of forces are bright regions
and the dark region is the pole. For a vortex, we should see a
bright ring. We have also explained how to write 711 using an
organic gel. These are generic problems, for the real world the
problem is different.
Automated filtering of groups in a given image, automatic decomposition of fractal seeds: In a given 2D image,

Nanobrain

where the corners or singularity centers that burst with distinct
resonance frequency values are naturally coupled, by a clocking wave remain within the helical hardware. The time crystal
or time crystal is memorized by a static distribution of charge
on the helical structure, it never goes outside. When the vortex
atom assembly carrying the stored time crystal enters into the
resonance chain, then what happens? Resonance chain is not a
living matter, it is a distribution of resonance frequencies in
widely separated materials and the assembly of vortex atoms
carrying the time crystal physically flows to transfer the geometric seed. Since the is no wiring how do they know where
to go? Electromagnetically coupled oscillations of many components acting as the members of the resonance chain set the
path of time domains. A circuit of time comes into being.
A time crystal binds with the resonance chain in the tome
domain where it fits. The hardware acts as a sensor jelly.
One of the remarkable aspects of this automated filtering
of geometric shapes on the resonance chain is that all possible time crystals are isolated. As a natural property of the
oscillators, each group of oscillators generates the nearest
fractal polygons, and its equivalent rhythms or clocks. Thus,
the entire input pattern is grouped into a nest of clocks; if
there are many resonance chains each representing a typical PPM or a particular functional organ of the human brain
then, automatically the class of information is sent at the
right places. It is like an artificial hippocampus. The continuous oscillations in a certain layer of oscillators generate an
image replica of a low frequency version in the above layer,
this is how even a normal image becomes a fractal, a triangle
has three points and all three of them gets a triangle inside
each. Not just that an event does not reside at one temporal
layer or one imaginary world of the brain, but in all. Thus,
entire information lives at all places, just as fractal information theory, FIT demands. One of the major problems for
using such a pen that solves big data instantly is that once it
learns a new problem, it can solve only that class of problems.
Imagine an algorithm that learns A, could read A for any
kind of handwriting.

9.10.1 Capsules of Brain Jelly—One
Each for One Big Problem
Therefore, the obvious question arises, what should one do,
buy a new capsule from the online market to solve a particular
class of problems? The answer to reusability lies in a beautiful
research field developed by Ghosh et al. on the programmable
matter (2015a). One of the benchmark challenges of
computer science is to build a simulator that automatically
learns complex rhythms or waveforms, memorize and
reproduce whenever necessary (Jaeger and Haas, 2004).
Several black-box computer models were implemented in
harnessing this non-linearity; however, reservoirs embed
tricks and thus limited to a few specific kinds of rhythms
(Buisson, 2004). Randomness enables a starting function to
match the variations of time series (Jaeger and Haas, 2004).
Instead of software, if a matter can emulate a complex rhythm,

instantly all part of the solution at once. Brain jelly is a mixture of electrolytic polymer (red) and oligomers (green) in a cylindrical tube.
While positive and negatively charged polymers create a vertical column of astronomically large number of cavities by chemical bond, the
oligomers sensitive to composition of ac frequencies, build helices, and physically self-assembles the helices to maximize the absorption of
modulated ac signal. Seven distinct densities of oligomer gradients ensure seven distinct size distributions of helix cluster, size is minimum

then an understanding of the language of biological systems
might lead to medical treatment, chronopathology (Sainz and
Halberg, 1966).
Historical background and contemporary research
on programmable matter: The programmable matter was
proposed as a hypothetical material that is flexible (“wind
tunnel at one moment, polymer soup at the next”; Toffoli
and Margolus, 1991, 1993), instantly reconfigurable, shows
variable resolution, intelligent sensing, integrated actuator and locomotors, as it engages in invisible computing.
Invisible computing means primarily working with virtual
atoms, or waves, like quantum, where electron like real particles are invisible (McCarthy, 2003; Goldstein et al., 2009;
MacLennan, 2002; Wong et al., 2012). Proteins game with
music requires special attention (Wong et al., 2012). In 1991,
Toffoli and Mergolus proposed programmable matter is a
material absorbs a particular form of energy, say light, sound,
magnetic, electric field, etc., and changes its structure typically to encode the parameters of the input signal. In a rhythm

or time fractal, a few frequencies together form a complex
time series. The programmable matter is yet to face a benchmark problem of computer science (Jaeger and Haas, 2004);
no true usable material was ever synthesized. By making
materials that replicate rhythms we satisfy both the essentials for a true programmable matter. Our brain, even a single
DNA molecule is a “programmable matter,” this suggests a
matter would by itself learn the hidden intelligence in a complex information packet and replicate that and no algorithm is
essential. The proposed computing paradigm challenges the
very necessity of a software program and the very need for
CMOS based electronic world. Both soft and hard part is done
by the material itself. Obviously, the invention should come
from materials science. Though proposed in 1991, no experimental demonstration existed until now. When billions of data
are being processed, and we have no clue regarding its hidden pattern, without building up the complete algorithm the
programmable material can learn the phenomenon and reproduce. It could be the ultimate goal for artificial intelligence.

284

Brain jelly in that sense a true programmable matter, however,
the brain has 47 Brodmann’s region integrated for universal
processing, that is absent in the cortical pen.
Some examples are evolving neural network, nano-wheel
as integrated machine, replication of natural phenomena
on molecular surface (Bandyopadhyay and Acharya, 2008;
Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2010b, 2010c). However,
biological rhythms are key to the ultimate programmable
matter like our brain or even DNA. Bio-systems encode and
decode rhythms to run highly interconnected machines simultaneously; though the thrust to make an artificial programmable matter is increasing rapidly, no usable material exists that
learns rhythms naturally and encode it in its dynamics. If realized this material would alleviate the necessity of algorithm,
open the door to a new class of self-reconfiguration, cloaking,
self-learning, encrypting, etc. Here, an organic jelly made of
spiral nanowires changes its length and helical pitch during
growth to mimic the composition of frequencies pumped into
it. The cluster of spirals drive the self-assembly to a particular
kind of fractal network that encodes the rhythm, so we can
read/write ANY encoded rhythm or time crystal. The jelly
learns several complex rhythms pumped into it operates without algorithm; learning and memorization finish within a few
seconds with zero human intervention at any step. However,
if one deletes the gel, converts into a liquid, all memory is
deleted. Partial deletion with a clever choice of locations is
utmost important and time crystal-based deletion does that
amicably.
Multi-layered clocks govern a biological system using
rhythms or time fractals or frequency fractals (Cipra, 2003).
A material that replicates the dynamics of biological rhythm,
could compute without using any machine language or algorithm (Ghosh et al., 2015a) intelligence hidden in the complex
rhythms (mathematically, rhythm = time fractal ~ frequency
fractal or frequency packet) get automatically decoded by the
matter (Buisson, 2004). It demands a dynamic material that
programs a complex time series.
Geometry programs in the time crystal: Fourth-circuit
element Hinductor is a programmable matter seed, which
takes a new shape, a new length pitch, diameter, and lattice
parameters a and b depending on which time crystal is given
in the solution as an input. The idea to create a programmable
matter that emulates bio-rhythms is to harness a unique feature of a spiral geometry. A spiral material’s electromagnetic
resonance frequencies depend on its geometrical parameters,
pitch and radius (Michalski and Mele, 2008; Atanasov and
Dandoloff, 2008). The length also plays a role in governing its
frequency, now if we enable a material to grow in a chemical
beaker such that as a function of input frequency the material shapes its spirals then the resultant material would be a
programmable matter that encodes rhythms. With this idea,
we have carried out extensive synthetic chemistry work and
realized an organic jelly that exhibits this feature.
Spiral wiring has the advantage that as its pitch P and
perimeter 2π R ratio P = ± 2πc R that governs periodic potential V ( x, y ) = Acos ( y − Px ) / R changes the resonance band
or the processing frequency. The fractional changes in the

Nanobrain

bandgap are given by F (α , 0 ) = α a2 [ 4 P 2 4σ 2 −(1+ P 2 )2 ] ~ ∆hυ .
It has already been shown that the effective electromagnetic
resonance band potential could be regulated in the spiral
structures by tuning the ratio as curvature controls potentials Veff = Vkin + 2 µV2curv (µ, energy difference with Fermi level;
Michalski and Mele, 2008; Atanasov and Dandoloff, 2008).
The helical pitch of the structures produced changes significantly to capture different frequency signals in the input
packet. If we compare the elementary spiral in an organic gel
that undergoes 1000-time increment in dimension in the spiral
grows as a spiral, Ghosh et al. (2016b). The elementary 20 nm
wide nanowire of has electromagnetic resonance in the GHz,
as the physical ratio changes by 1000 times the resonance frequency decrease by 1000 times to the MHz domain. Analysis
based on existing formulation itself explains why spiral geometry enables the materialistic capability to encode the rhythm.
Thenceforth the work has been extended to abundantly available spiral, fractal, vortex-like organic super nano-structures.
Ghosh et al. made the first demonstration of a usable material
that learns and programs rhythms. Here, rhythm or time series
or time crystal acts as a programming language; one could create multiple rhythm processing materials at different regions of
a beaker simultaneously, by inducing physical cavities. Then,
the rhythm of rhythms or “time crystals” (Winfree, 1977a), i.e.,
a singular complex waveform as a superposition of multiple frequency packets be given as input and multiple rhythms at different parts of the beaker would generate new composite rhythms.
Currently, learning and replication finish in seconds, however,
constraints can edit rhythms to run for hours, if possible, years,
until materials get exhausted. Once we learn to erase a material pattern and restructure a part of it with new rhythms, i.e.,
learn to work with a fixed amount of material forever, then this
organic jelly would truly be a brain jelly.

9.11 A SENSOR THAT SEARCHES FOR GIVEN
KEYS, DO NOT SENSE ANY INPUT
Eventually, the entire human brain is a sensor. The journey to
study a brain jelly begins by detecting a singularity condition of
a clock, when and how it’s phase change becomes undefined for a
certain time, when something else defines phase (Figure 9.16a).
Mathematics of “self-assembly of time crystals” and
“phase transition of time crystals”: The building of a time
crystal is a time crystal, just like software algorithm, but
here, many interesting features could spontaneously evolve
(Figure 9.16b). Self-assembly of time crystals is fusion of
two time fractals, the rule of fusion is that the non-harmonic
set of frequencies U t ( n ) which represents a typical composition of geometric shapes is not diluted, one example is
T = t1 + t 2 + t 3 … + tn, while the time fractal g ( t ) transforms
to f ( t ) after fusion, and f ( t ) satisfies f ( t + T ) = f ( t ). For a
distinct information content for all n, t ( n ) are not harmonic, thus, inharmonicity represents distinct contents in an
information packet, while harmonicity makes a boundary,
thus isolates information packets S U t ( n ) from mixing.
It is self-assembly of time crystal as it grows continuously

and transforms. The transformation also runs by a governing time crystal (Figure 9.16c). Due to harmonics, the identity
of U t ( n ) is preserved, it acts as an observer of the entire
system. Phase transition is switching between two time fractals, g ( t ) → b ( t ), if number of terms of U t ( n ) in g ( t ) in
the course of time changes to M t ( n ) that represents b ( t ).
Once phase transition starts, it propagates through the entire
system.
A single time fractal evolves after fusing with more and
more packets, the fusion satisfies integral feature explained
above which naturally satisfies the condition for synchronicity. It should be noted that just like fusion, phase transition
rules can have multilayered architectures, “nested network
of rules.” One phase transition condition is met, one decision is taken, however mostly multiple conditions are met
then a new time fractal is born, possibly in a different time
domain, on the resonance chain that represents the hardware, the fusion-fission and phase transition can have in
two far distantly separated rhythm on the resonance chain.

Synchronization of two different rhythms is also represented
as attractors how sync is used in a fusion of time crystals.
Interactions of different fractals could happen in many different ways generating binaural beats and several other kinds
of locking process at different time scales “composition of
time fractals” is a superposition of multiple rhythms. It is
not multi-fractal where at a different scale we find different
fractal dimension. However, to resolve a problem, brain jelly
filters a time crystal following PPM. The governing system is
also a time crystal (Figure 9.16d).
Construction, transformation, and filtering or rearranging
the time crystal is part of solving a problem. The time crystalbased brain jelly discussed here, converts all events happening in nature into time crystal using GML, thereby solves only
one problem, that is called Clique problem, which is simply
finding a pattern in a complex pattern.
The NP-complete intractable “Clique” problem and a
universal “reply back” protocol: The clique problem is a
well-defined intractable problem, where one has to search a

286

given pattern in the complex set of patterns. The clique problem needs to be solved in a finite time for any advanced cognitive or creative intelligence observed even in primitive neural
networks, this is our perception about brain engineering. Most
input data convert into an unknown pattern that brain jelly has
never encountered before, be it visual, sound, touch, taste or
smell. Obviously, the number of possible patterns that could be
generated from this composition is astronomically large. Now,
if we want to search 15 given known pattern in that resource
input, it is not possible to find that pattern with any computer
within a finite time. However, if those points have the properties to reply back together spontaneously then we can get
the search result without searching. As noted above that to
avoid the screening effect we need a new kind of material that
would follow the resonance chain throughout the architecture.
There exist several classes of the clique problem originally
proposed in 1949, as frequently observed in the classically
intractable problems, a certain constraint is imposed to simplify the complex network and then an algorithmic route is
found to solve that problem. However, in this particular case,
we take any sensory data, visual, sound, touch, taste or smell
in the form of a 2D pattern and from that image we transform
the single image into several layers of images, each containing
several different classes of “frequency fractal” seeds. During
transformation each layer distinctly represents a particular
type of fractal seeds, based on the size of the basic geometric
shapes used that incorporates global relationship of elements
in a pattern. The network between various kinds of fractals is
generated due to the typical conical architecture of the entire
computing network.

9.11.1 Eleven Dimensional Signals in the
Human Brain and in Brain Jelly
A review of the experimental research described in this
book and the final discussion on the experimental realization of a full-fledged organic brain: The potential of
pattern-based computing was never explored to the fullest.
Scientists have always tried to look for the computing constructs that would lead to logical operation. Scientists created
the smallest molecular neural network, nano-wheel for the
glia inspired circuiting and then the cellular automaton based
massively parallel computing on the organic molecular layer,
we have described them in Chapter 6. It was realized that
neither computing constructs help us to generate bioinspired
computing nor the analog pattern formation similar to a particular physical phenomenon. Thus, we started the building
of brain jelly, which is an organic molecular structure that
vibrates like a particular composition of electric magnetic
and mechanical rhythm. The hierarchical memory in the
chemical reaction is essential to program the entire growth
of the brain in a single set of H or hinductor devices, which
would be analogous to DNA in biology and then explore condensation beyond chemical kinetics, two remarkable tools
that take us to the original brain jelly experiments. We have
detailed, the final phase how 17 brain-morphic components,
each encodes a typical PPM. Seventeen types of brain jelly

Nanobrain

have been synthesized. All neuron wires made of H2 devices
(second generation Hinductor) should grow one by one and
extend to the final destination via H3 modules. From sensors to the editing regions of the brain and finally to the
cortex domain there is linear wiring wherever we want to
preserve the fractal-seed and do not want it to interact with
anything else, we need to grow the circuits carefully there.
Such a massive scale self-assembled supramolecular architecture was never done before. Now, other than the delicate
places, we use neuron jelly wherein neurons could re-orient
and reconstruct circuits based on internal axon restructuring. Figure 9.17 lists how after growing brain jelly how one
could actually read 12-dimensional data. Since the technology is optimized, the brain jelly was injected into the brain
of a robot (Figure 9.17, right); 3D printing components are
already optimized and listed below. The growth of the brain
jelly could be observed live at nanoscale using a scanning
electron microscope (SEM).

9.11.2 Humanoid Avatar—An Ultimate Sensor
Humans would transform with artificial sensor arrays (Guntner
et al., 2018); now it is possible to create a humanoid avatar
to test the brain jelly or any form of morphological computation (Hauser et al., 2011). Since resonance chain connects
all computing seeds, wireless processing is feasible without a
screening effect, also we do not need to create an antenna with
enormous power to wirelessly transfer signals from one part
of the brain to another. The computing power is increased by
maximizing the density of resonance states and bandwidth of
the resonance chain together. Below we describe how we have
experimentally developed the first version of organic nanobrain that forms the brain jelly while learning from its immediate environment. It is not the brain jelly for the ultimate brain,
but, this is the first step toward that direction. The humanoid
avatar is a resonance chain. The Shannon information capacity of space-time wireless channels formed by electromagnetic
sources and receivers in a known background medium is analyzed from the fundamental physics point of view of Maxwell’s
equations (Gruber and Marengo, 2008).
Wide ranges of vortex solids and liquids (Huber, 1994) generating time crystals, could be tested on the 47 cortex domains
of the humanoid avatar that we built. Several prototypes of
humanoid avatars have been created and some of them are
available in the market, but they run by algorithm, they don’t
have PPM, the mother of all programmers. Moreover, no
effort was ever made to meticulously create the entire neural
network of a human body, build every single component using
wide ranges of materials by 3D printing and then filling the
cavities using suitable jelly. The prime concern that arises,
how do we test that the humanoid bot is conscious. The same
way we understand, the other humans are conscious, talking
and interacting with it, on random topics. The main idea of
this book is to explore the possibility of building a human
brain that is non-chemical, has no software or pre-determined
algorithm, and thus processes unknown, unpredictable events
instantly and perpetually, without training.

9.12 SENSOR TRIAD, SENSOR JELLY,
MUSCLE JELLY, AND BRAIN JELLY
Eventually it is the spiral wave and its critical propagation
limits (Karma, 1991) in a given excitable media that regulates the performance of a jelly. The scaling regime helps
to optimize scale-free operation of a jelly, (Karma, 1992).
Sensor triad, the sensor jelly, muscle jelly and the brain jelly
would differ only in geometric features exhibited by the jelly;
see Figure 9.18. Spiral waves propagate adopting different
geometric features (Keener, 1986) in three types of jellies.
Vortex filaments generate emulating the geometric parameters (Keener, 1990) required for sensing geometric shapes,
executing mechanical movement and sensing the symmetry
of primes. It is not one, but many waves dealing with many
singularities (Koga, 1982b). The geometry of path or cavity reconfigures distribution of singularities (Kogan et al.,
1992) in an auto wave (Krinsky, 1987). The sensor triad does
not provide the ability to self-create or autopoiesis (Varela
et al., 1974). Be it a sensor jelly or muscle jelly or brain jelly,
for a typical component in the brain, a particular time domain

has to be selected. Time-based priority has to be given. We
discuss below, why one has to classify organic jelly based on
time domain.
The fractal time domain distribution among different
brain components: The neural network or brain jelly in the
artificial brain of Humanoid avatar is so designed that time
domain-distribution has inverse one-to-one correspondence
with the resource priority of the brain, something like: “we
give the highest priority to the visual data, then the sound
data and finally to smell and then touch, in the absence of
higher control, lower control-data takes over as the priority
resource.” Higher is the priority; lower is the time domain,
now, to avoid any possible conflict some more rules are
required for synchrony-de-­synchrony flipping. First, the
maximum and the minimum of total synchronization time for
a particular domain do not overlap with any other regions,
phase diagram reveals a pure communication (Matthews and
Strogatz, 1990). Second, since complex time crystals couple
neurons from two or more regions, the synchronization time
is determined by the 3D pattern shape created by the coupled
neuron network, it is faster if the shape is more symmetric.

Chatbot: Quite a peace in life, a vegetarian Indian was he, walk a
mile, karamdas known to many, non-violence that of humanity, a
person to remember.

FIGURE 9.18 A comparison between the sensor jelly, muscle jelly, and the brain jelly. To the right a table compares the similarities and
the differences between the biological neural network and the artificial brain jelly. Below is a photograph how the synthesis of a humanoid
avatar begins at the skeleton level and eventually how software-generated chat-bot speaks about anything without prior knowledge.

Nonlocal interaction of spiral waves always happens (Meron,
1989), it can organize infinite number of H devices like organisms (Siegert and Weijer, 1995). Third, synchronization time
is artificially defined: in a continuous synchronization and desynchronization process, the 3D pattern-shape inside which
neurons are actively playing the game of synchrony changes
continuously, therefore, there is no distinct division between
any two events; we consider that an event is completed when a
large 3D pattern shrinks to a minimum. In the world of wireless communication, we simply add more wire-connections;
make it hybrid-wireless to tune time domain at will.
Organization and re-organization of time-domain:
Simultaneously, during oscillation, in the Humanoid avatar,
the global convergence rules are superimposed on the oscillatory wave using a hierarchical buffer antenna. The time
domain of transmission for superimposing the higher-level
rules should match with the time domain of oscillatory transformation wave. The convergence generated in the distributed
local regions of the upper brain is updated regularly as transformed time crystal cluster in the global periodic oscillation
of the resource buffer antenna; therefore, its time domain
should be faster than the transformation process. Once localdistributed regions stop generating new time crystals, the

updated time crystal-cluster is sent to the resource buffer at
the same time domain by which the resource antenna sends a
signal to its buffer.

9.12.1 A Total Transformation from the Biological
Neural Net to a Jelly of Time Crystals
Biological neural network and artificial brain jelly placed on
the head of a Humanoid avatar are fundamentally different
(Figure 9.18). Since ionic and chemical reaction based systems are avoided completely in the operation of humanoid
avatar or brain jelly, an enormous number of problems have
been avoided. Of course, brain jelly is organic; however, production, editing, and processing of time crystal do not require
any chemical reaction. Whenever there would be chemical
processing, there would be a waste—rather, here, physical
reorganization of H, H2, and H3 devices is the key operating
factors. Brain jelly is a quantum processor at the molecular
scale and classical processor at the macro scale. Time crystals operate smoothly between classical and quantum domain
because of fractal mechanics, that enables dodecanion,
octonion, and quaternion tensors to regulate the interactive
dynamics between the brain components.

Brain Jelly to Humanoid Avatar—Fractal Reaction Kinetics, Fractal Condensation, and Programmable Matter

Quantum models of the human brain: Brain’s activity is
related to quantum and even consciousness (Beck and Eccles,
1992). Space-time metric has been used by several physicists
to explain consciousness, for example Lowen model (Lowen
and Miike, 1982) was the first to consider gravitational lensing to generate consciousness. Spatial function becomes
irrelevant; most importantly, E. Surowitz argued for spacetime generated neural cycles or rhythms as the origin of consciousness (Surowitz, 2011). Directional computing becomes
unnecessary, and they considered a feedback loop to generate
time-invariance. It is exactly what happens in a time crystal.
As a driving force an evolved Lowen model considers dual
face to face conical-shaped lens formation, and its hierarchical
network. Orch-OR theory (Penrose and Hameroff, 1996) that
argues for gravitational collapse to explain consciousness just
like the Lowen model makes another contribution, it includes
a remarkable biological molecule microtubule as the processing unit, microtubule in axon is a singular wire, that means
in giraffe, a 10 ft neck has one neuron and possibly a 10 ft
long single molecule. Since all single molecules are a quantum
device, the debate is not about the effect is quantum or not, the
true debate is how the hierarchical network and the language of
the brain are constructed. PPM protocol is a generic proposal
independent of a particular consciousness theory to provide
hitherto existing consciousness models a route to integrate
with all highly interconnected research fields. It is a journey to
consolidate Bayesian brain that correlates function and brain
image (Friston, 2011) on a concrete mechanistic pathway.

Decomposes Recursive functions of Undefined problems and simulates all scales at a time: Fractal machine,
brain jelly is designed to address undefined problems:
One of the finest features of fractal tape network is that the
machine can compose a rhythm inside a rhythm inside a
rhythm... or clock inside a clock inside a clock wherever it sees
in nature in any known or unknown form. Mathematically
it is argued by infinite fractal time series, such a fractal of
rhythms enables a machine to generate 99.99% of all possible
rhythms in its environment or user with which the machine
is locked. As a result of it, the machine does not require to
define a particular phenomenon that is not known to the
machine. The machines embedded can resonate with the 11D
scale recursive functions naturally evolving in the universe
in its frequency fractal network. It decomposes the dynamics
to find the function that repeats itself and generate the entire
composition of rhythms, it means the sensor builds the time
crystal. When the time crystal is expanded using the PPM, as
we read it from the Humanoid avatar using several EEG and
multi-channel analyzer cables, the evolved architecture builds
the patterns of the past present and future simultaneously in
the network. Thus, brain jelly can address unknown events
and situations. Therefore, it is not far brain jelly filled avatar
would start thinking like a human brain (Binnig et al., 2002).
One such classified effort’s glimpse is shown in Figure 9.18
end. The final humanoid bot is not shown here, but its conversation is noted. It is not good in grammar but would surely
learn in the coming future.

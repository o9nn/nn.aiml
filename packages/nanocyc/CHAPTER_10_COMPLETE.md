  - Sensation Wheel (1000/sec)
  - Perception Wheel (100/sec)
  - Cognition Wheel (10/sec)
  - Emotion Wheel (1/sec)
  - Memory Wheel (1/min)
  - Wisdom Wheel (1/day)
  - Evolution Wheel (1/year)

### 10.12 Synthesis of Aliens Before Meeting Them
- Predicting and creating non-human consciousness
- Prime-geometry language exploration
- Three alien consciousness types:
  - Silicon-based (logic-first)
  - Quantum-coherent (superposition awareness)
  - Time-reversed (future-memory beings)

### 10.13 A Cycle: Garden to Flower to Petal
- Complete consciousness transformation journey:
  - Garden Phase: Biological consciousness
  - Flower Phase: Conscious egg emergence
